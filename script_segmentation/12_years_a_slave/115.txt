INT. YARNEY'S HOUSE  EVENING 127

A party has commenced at the noble home of one MR.
YARNEY. A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the
dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with
a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of
celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A
GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does
so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good
time is being had by all.
