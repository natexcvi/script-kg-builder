EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD  DAY

FEBRUARY, 1853
The Slaves are sewing the heavily plowed field, making
their way in the trying soil. Solomon, too focused to
note the arrival of two men by carriage Parker and the
SHERIFF.
While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker
remains with the carriage. The Sheriff calls
SHERIFF
Platt...? Where is the boy called
Platt?
SOLOMON
...Sir...
The Sheriff crosses to him.
SHERIFF
Your name is Platt, is it?
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
Pointing off to the distance.
SHERIFF
Do you know that man?
118A.
168  168
Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his
eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him.
But when it does, it hits him as a rush.
SOLOMON
Mr. Parker...?
168  2 168
Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the
Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity.
SHERIFF
Say again?
SOLOMON
Mr. Parker?
As he does, Epps makes his way over.
SHERIFF
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations. You
look me in the eye and on your
life answer me truthfully have
you any other name than Platt?
SOLOMON
Solomon Northup is my name.
EPPS
Sheriff...
SHERIFF
Have you a family?
EPPS
What's all this?
SHERIFF
It's official business.
EPPS
My nigger, my business.
SHERIFF
Your business waits.
TO SOLOMON
Tell me of your family.
SOLOMON
I have a wife and two children.
SHERIFF
What were your children's names?
SOLOMON
Margaret and Alonzo.
SHERIFF
And your wife's name before her
marriage?
SOLOMON
Anne Hampton. I am who I say.
Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward
Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his
119A.
168  3 168
personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two
old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other
in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by
Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff.
168  4 168
EPPS
Nah... You will unhand 'em.
Platt is my nigger!
PARKER
He is Solomon Northup.
EPPS
You say...
PARKER
He belongs to no man.
EPPS
You say! You come here,
unfamiliar to me, and make claims.
SHERIFF
Not claims. I have no doubts.
This is Solomon Northup, a
resident of Saratoga Springs, NY.
EPPS
To hell with that! My nigger, and
I will fight you for 'em!
PARKER
As is your right. As it will be
my pleasure to bankrupt you in the
courts. Your decision.
By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome
their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered
in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,
out of sight of Epps.
Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda
next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed
emotion.
Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds
his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance
that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there
to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to
BACK DOWN
EPPS
You think this is the last you will
see of me, boy? It ain't.
TO PARKER
Whatever paper you hold about his
freedom, it don't mean naught. He
is my nigger  and I will have my
day in court, sir. As God as my
witness, I will have my day in
court. Take 'em!
Epps calls to Bob
120A.
168  5 168
EPPS CONT'D
Saddle my horse! And bring her up
here.
Epps walks back into the plantation.
The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back
by the call of Patsey's voice
PATSEY
Platt...
Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
Solomon and they embrace.
Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
rides off furiously.
Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps
PARKER
Solomon...if we know what's wise,
we should depart.
A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They
separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and
Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they
168  6 168
start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the
ground, where she remains in a weary and halfreclining
state, the other slaves around her.
WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
from the slaves  who are diminished by distance.
Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a
bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
forever more.
