EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON  CONTINUOUS

Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred
window of Burch's dungeon  Solomon's cries barely eking
beyond the space  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the

HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING  fairly mocking Solomon's
captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and
cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's
procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight.
