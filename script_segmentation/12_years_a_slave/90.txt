INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S  LATER 101

A general store in the township of Holmesville. Solomon
stands at the counter as BARTHOLOMEW fills Mistress
Epps's order. Among the items set before Solomon is a
QUANTITY OF FOOLSCAP.
The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack.
Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting
them back to the mistress.
As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints,
of all different guises chains, muzzles for sale.
