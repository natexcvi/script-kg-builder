INT. GADSBY HOTEL/SOLOMON'S ROOM  NIGHT 23

Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where
a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the
bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton
speaks sweetly.
HAMILTON
I am afraid that Brown and I
haven't brought you much luck.
But rough waters bring smooth
sailing. Eventually they do.
SOLOMON
....So...so sorry...
HAMILTON
Shhh. We won't hear it. We
won't.
BROWN
Let him sleep.
HAMILTON
Hmm. A good night's sleep. And
tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed as though
the earth were new again.
Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of
SIGNIFICATION
BROWN
Hamilton! Nothing more we can do
for him.
HAMILTON
Such is the pity.
Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks
away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A
CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than
night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the
dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE
DISTRESSED.
