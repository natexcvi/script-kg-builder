EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD  DAY

AUGUST, 1842
WE START THE SCENE WITH A PAIR OF  HANDS
picking cotton ferociously. As we move out, we identify
PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman. The camera
moves out again to a wider shot. This reveals several
lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in
the lead. 
We cut to another pair of black hands. This time,
revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking
cotton. A lash bears down on him.
It is August, cotton picking season.
We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It
presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of
light, newfallen snow. The cotton grows from five to
seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches

shooting out in all directions and lapping each other
above the water furrow.
There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a
sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the
mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed
at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of
cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are
again filled.
EDWARDS
Pick that cotton. Move along now.
THE TRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE
RUSTLE OF LABOR, THE MALE CICADAS BUGS TYMBALS IN THE
HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES.
Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The
slaves are driven by Edward, who is himself driven by
Treach.
TREACH
C amon. Drive dem niggers.
Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them
without regard.
EDWARD
Pick dat cotton. Move along now,
hear?
