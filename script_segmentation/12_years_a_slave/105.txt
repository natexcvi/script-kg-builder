EXT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION  EVENING 117

OCTOBER, 1846
Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a
cart. SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM. Epps has
delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man
and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on
Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf. Epps and
Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as
Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch.
One of the slaves whisper under their breath.
EPPS' SLAVE
I hear cutting cane is twice as
hard as picking cotton.
BOB
But at least we will be away from
Master Epps.
UNCLE ABRAM
Boy, you two have no sense.
Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting
salutation.
EPPS
Yer Judge Turner's for the season.
More if need be, until my crop
return. Yah will bring no
disrespect to me, and yah will bring
no biblical plagues to him. Be
decent, ere mark my words, I will
deliver an ungodly whippin'.
