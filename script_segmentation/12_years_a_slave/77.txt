INT. FORD PLANATION/GREAT HOUSE  NIGHT

As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on
the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He
is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his
bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS
HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to
the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has
largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It
will be the first and last time such a sumptuous resting
place was granted during his twelve years of bondage.

Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his
surroundings. He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and
is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he
started?
From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He
goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see
nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.
He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.
FORD
I believe Tibeats is skulkin'
about the premises somewhere. He
wants you dead, and he will
attempt to have you so. It's no
longer safe for you here. And I
don't believe you will remain
passive if Tibeats attacks. I
have transferred my debt to Edwin
Epps. He will take charge of you.
SOLOMON
desperate, urgent
Master Ford, you must know I am
not a slave.
FORD
I cannot hear that.
SOLOMON
Before I came to you I was a
freeman.
FORD
I am trying to save your life!
And...I have a debt to be mindful
of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps.
He is a hard man. Prides himself
on being a nigger breaker. But
truthfully I could find no others
who would have you. You have made a
reputation of yourself. Whatever
your circumstances, you are an
exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear
no good will come of it.
