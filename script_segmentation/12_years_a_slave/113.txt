EXT. TURNER PLANTATION  NIGHT  126 

Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting
by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his
fiddle. It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.
Dipping the piece of cane  a quill  into the crushed
berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.
The berry juice, too freeflowing, is unusable as ink.
Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some
scraps of food with him, which he snacks on.
