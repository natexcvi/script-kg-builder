EXT. FORD PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE  DAY

As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon
with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously
owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's
gratitude is easily expressed.

SOLOMON
My great thanks, Master Ford.
FORD
My thanks to you, and it is the
least of it. My hope is that it
brings us both much joy over the
years.
Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
He remains grateful, but the thought of over the years
is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now
finds himself.
