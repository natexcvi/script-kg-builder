INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK  NIGHT

The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters,
without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment
there's curiosity is he there for a dance, for
Patsey...?
Looking right to Solomon
EPPS
Get up.
Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He
says nothing, but his directive is clear Follow me.
