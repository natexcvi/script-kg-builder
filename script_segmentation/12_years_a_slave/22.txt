INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON  DAWN

24  24
Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
masonry. There is a thick and welllocked door, a small
window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
CUFFED  the chain running to a bolt in the ground  and
his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
state he remains.
