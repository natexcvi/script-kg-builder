EXT. PARK/PAVILION  LATER

We make a jump to a green space. Solomon, Brown and
Hamilton are sitting at a bench.
SOLOMON
A circus?
HAMILTON
That is our usual employee. The
company currently in the city of
Washington.
BROWN
Circus too constricting a word to
describe the talented and merry
band with which we travel. It is
a spectacle unlike most have ever
witnessed. Creatures from the
darkest Africa as yet unseen by
civilized man. Acrobats from the
Orient able to contort themselves
in the most confounding manners.
HAMILTON
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown
an internationally renowned
practitioner in the art of
prestidigitation.
BROWN
We are on our way thither to
rejoin the company having left for
a short time to make a small
profit from our own exhibitions.
HAMILTON
The reason for our inquiry with
Mr. Moon...
BROWN
Yes. We had just a devil of a
time in procuring music for our

entertainments. Men of true
talent seemingly in short supply.
SOLOMON
Thank you sir...
BROWN
If we could persuade you to
accompany us as far as New York...
We would give you one dollar for
each day's service and three
dollars for every night played at
our performances. In addition we
would provide sufficient pay for
the expenses of your return from
New York here to Saratoga.
SOLOMON
You understand this is all very
sudden.
HAMILTON
Consider it an opportunity to see
THE COUNTRY
SOLOMON
It's intriguing...
HAMILTON
If there is any way in which you
would give consideration to the
offer...
Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration.
SOLOMON
The payment offered is enticement
enough, as is my desire to visit
the metropolis.
HAMILTON
We are delighted, sir. So
delighted. Though we would add
that our travel plans
BROWN
We would like to depart with
haste.

SOLOMON
As luck would have it, my wife and
children are traveling. I will
write her of our plans.
BROWN
Excellent! I would beg you
collect yourself, then we may
proceed.
