INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON  EVENING A32

Radburn brings food in to Solomon a shriveled piece of
meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain
Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.
RADBURN
That old thing of yours is just
rags and tatters. Need something
proper to wear.
Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.
RADBURN CONT'D
Go'won. Put it on.
With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He
removes what remains of his old shirt  the one he was
wearing when first kidnapped  and puts on the one
Radburn brought him. The shirt's illfitting and dirty.
Despite that, Radburn says
RADBURN CONT'D
There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine.
Got no gratitude?
SOLOMON
...Thank you...
RADBURN
Yah keep bein' proper, yah will see
how things work out.
Radburn starts to take the old shirt.
SOLOMON
No! It was from my wife.
RADBURN
Rags and tatters. Rags and
tatters.
Taking the shirt, the rags and tatters as he calls
them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.
Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He
pushes the plate away rather than eat.
