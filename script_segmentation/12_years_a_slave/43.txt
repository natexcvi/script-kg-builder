EXT. ORLEANS/DECK  DAY 51 

We are back up on the deck of the ship. SOLOMON AND 
CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT's body over the side of the ship. 
Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the
wake of the vessel... then sinks beneath the water. 
Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality
CLEMENS RAY 
Better off. Better than us.
