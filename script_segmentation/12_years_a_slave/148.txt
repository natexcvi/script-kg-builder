EXT. ROAD BY EPPS' PLANTATION  EVENING A168

Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
something that is a million miles away.
Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
He then repeats the action.
Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
ground.
He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
bits  silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
an odd way, respectful.
