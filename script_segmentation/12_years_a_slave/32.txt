EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/INT. WAGON/FLAT BED  LATER

The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and
carriage. They are made to lay down sidebyside. We stay
with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them,
obscuring and blacking out their view.
At that moment, the screen is ENED and we hear the
sound of the cart moving in haste.
