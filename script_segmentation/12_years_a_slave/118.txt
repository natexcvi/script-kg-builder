EXT. TURNER PLANTATION  NIGHT 130

FEBRUARYMARCH, 1847
Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a
low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the
edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen
from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of
about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.
IT REQUIRED  INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD. Beyond
that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.
It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in
her dress.
Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As
Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite
PLAINLY
CELESTE
I am hungry. Give me food.
SOLOMON
Who are you?
CELESTE
I am hungry.
Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,
famished, devours it.
SOLOMON
What is your name?
CELESTE
My name is Celeste.
SOLOMON
What are your circumstances?
CELESTE
I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave
been two days among da palmettoes.
Celeste is sick and cain't work,
and would rather die in the swamp

CELESTE CONT'D
than be whipped to death by the
overseer. So I took myself away.
Massa's dogs won't follow me. The
patrollers 'ave tried to set dem
on me. But dey a secret between
dem and Celeste, and dey won't
mind the devilish orders of the
overseer.
Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.
CELESTE CONT'D
Do you believe me?
SOLOMON
Yes.
CELESTE
Why?
SOLOMON
There are some whose tracks the
hounds will refuse to follow.
CELESTE
Give me more food. I am starvin'.
SOLOMON
This is all my allowance for the
REST OF
CELESTE
Give it to me.
Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she
eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself
CELESTE CONT'D
Most slaves escape at night. The
overseers are alert for such
chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem
'n alight in the middle of the day
wit the sun up at its highest.
The place of my concealment now
deep in the swamp, not half a mile
from Massa's plantation, and a
world apart. A world a tall
trees whose long arms make fo' a
canopy so dense dey keep away even
the beams of the sun. It twilight
always in Celeste's world, even in
the brightest day. I will live
there, and I will live freely.
The overseers are a cowardly lot.
Dey will not go where their dogs
show fear and where it always be
night. Others will join me in the
twilight, and we ain't gunna be
slaves no  amo forever.

Solomon isn't sure what to say. Before he can say
ANYTHING
CELESTE CONT'D
Celeste will come to you again in
the night. You will have food for
her.
Celeste departs the way she came as though she were a
vision.
