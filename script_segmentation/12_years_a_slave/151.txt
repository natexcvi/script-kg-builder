INT. NORTHUP HOUSE  LATER

THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon
behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire the
Northup children Alonzo, who is now seventeen and
Margaret who is now twenty  SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They
are, after all  after twelve years  little more than
familiar strangers.
SOLOMON
I apologize for my appearance. I
have had a difficult time of
things these past many years.
Solomon looks among his family trying to recall them as
much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his
CHILDREN
SOLOMON CONT'D
Alonzo... Margaret, yes? You do
not recognize me, do you? Do

SOLOMON CONT'D
you...do you even remember the
last time we saw each other? I
put you on a carriage with your
mother...
Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost
breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the
UNKNOWN MAN
SOLOMON CONT'D
And who is this?
MARGARET
He is my husband.
SOLOMON
Husband?
MARGARET'S HUSBAND
It is very good to meet you, sir.
SOLOMON
We have much acquainting to do.
Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.
MARGARET
And this is your grandson.
Solomon Northup Staunton.
SOLOMON
...Solomon...
The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But
ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon
says to Anne with all his heart
SOLOMON CONT'D
Forgive me.
ANNE
There is nothing to forgive.
The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each
other for life...and one would think for all the rest of
their lives.
CARD
Upon gaining his freedom, Solomon Northup located and
attempted to seek legal justice against the men who
kidnapped him. The case was tried in Washington, DC
where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying

against whites. The charges against the kidnappers were
eventually dismissed.
Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death
remain unknown.
