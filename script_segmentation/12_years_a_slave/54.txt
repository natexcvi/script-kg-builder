EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA  DAY

John Tibeats, stands before the slaves. Chapin hovers to 
one side. 
TIS 
My name is John Tibeats, William 
Ford's chief carpenter. You will 
refer to me as Master. 
Tibeats nods in Chapin's direction 
TIS CONT'D 
Mister Chapin is the overseer on 
this plantation. He is 
responsible for all of Ford's 
property. You too will refer to 
him as Master. 
This plantation covers many 
hundreds of acres, and you will 
traverse the Texas road between 
the forest site and the sawmill in 
double time. Any clever nigger on 
that path that gets a little 
lightfooted, I will remind him 
that on one side men and 
bloodhounds patrol the border and 
on the other the bayou provides a 
hard living, with alligators and 
little to eat or drink that won't 
kill you. No slave has escaped 
here with his life. You are here 
to work niggers, so let's 
commence. 
Tibeats begins to sing the song Run Nigger, Run 
mockingly. 
We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of 
the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the 
sawmill.

Oh run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Nigger run nigger flew 
Nigger tore his shirt in two 
Run run the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Nigger run, run so fast 
Stoved his head in a hornets nest 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Nigger run through the field 
Black slick coal and barley heel 
Run nigger run the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Some folks say a nigger won't steal 
I caught three in my corn field 
One has a bushel? And one has a peck 
One had a rope and it was hung around his neck 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Oh nigger run and nigger flew 
Why in the devil can't a white man chew 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Hey Mr. Pattyroller don't catch me 
Catch that nigger behind that tree 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you? 
Run nigger run well you better get away 
Nigger run, run so fast 
Stoved his head in a hornets nest 
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you 
Run nigger run well you better get away
