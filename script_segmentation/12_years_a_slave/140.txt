EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE  DAY

As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation
going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the
art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled
mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does
little more than joke his way around the facts.
Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps
offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.
EPPS
Take it. You look unsettled.
BASS
I am well.
EPPS
No shame in taking respite from
the heat drink, shade. It's
ungodly for travelers. Hearty, or
otherwise.
102A.
B155  B155
Bass gives a laugh.
EPPS CONT'D
I meant no joke.
B155  2 B155
BASS
Your humor is inadvertent.
Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense,
Epps presses.
EPPS
Then share what's funny. Or what
ills you.
BASS
I am here to complete the work at
hand. As requested, and as paid.
EPPS
Something rubs you wrongly.
Before I take further offense, I
offer you the opportunity to speak
on it.
BASS
You ask plainly, I will tell you
plainly. What I find amusing You
worry about my well being in the
heat but, quite frankly, the
condition of your laborers
EPPS
The condition of my... What in
the hell are you
BASS
It is horrid. It's all wrong.
All wrong, sir.
EPPS
They ain't hired help. They are my
slaves.
BASS
You say that with pride.
EPPS
I say it as fact.
BASS
If the conversation concerns what
is factual and what is not
there's no justice nor
righteousness in slavery. I
wouldn't own a slave if I was rich
as Croesus, which I am not, as is
perfectly well understood. More
particularly among my creditors.
There's another humbug the credit
system. Humbug, sir. No credit,
no debt. Credit leads a man into
temptation. Cash down is the only
thing that will deliver him from

BASS CONT'D
evil. But this question of
slavery what right have you to
your niggers when you come down to
the point?
EPPS
What right? I bought 'em. I paid
for 'em.
BASS
Of course you did. The law says
you have the right to hold a
nigger, but begging the law's
pardon...it lies. Is everything
right because the law allows it?
Suppose they had pass a law taking
away your liberty and making you a
slave?
EPPS
Ha!
BASS
Suppose.
EPPS
That ain't a supposable case.
BASS
Because the law states that your
liberties are undeniable? Because
society deems it so? Laws change.
Social systems crumble. Universal
truths are constant. It is a
fact, it is a plain fact that what
is true and right is true and
right for all. White and black
alike.
EPPS
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yah compare me
to a nigger, Bass? Yah might as
well ask what the difference is
between a white man and a baboon.
Now, I seen one of them critters
in Orleans that knowed just as
much as any nigger I got. Yah had
call them fellers citizens, I
s'pose?
BASS
Look here you can't laugh me down
in that way. These niggers are
human beings. If they are allowed
to scale no higher than brute
animals, you and men like you will
have to answer for it. There's an
ILL
B155  4 B155
EPPS
Ahhh!
BASS
A fearful ill, resting on this
NATION
EPPS
You betray yourself a foreigner!
BASS
That will not go unpunished
forever. There will be a
reckoning yet.
EPPS
You like to hear yourself talk,
Bass, better than any man I know
of. Yah had argue that black was
white, or white black if anybody
would contradict you. A fine
supposition if yah lived among
Yankees in New England. But yah
don't.
POINTED
You most assuredly do not.
