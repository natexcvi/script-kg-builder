EXT. PARK  DAY

Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men  two
in particular  who stand outside conversing with MR.
MOON himself MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown
is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
him, slightly effeminate.
Moon, spotting Solomon
MR. MOON
Call the Devil's name... There he
is now. Mr. Northup...! I have
two gentlemen who should make your
acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and
Hamilton.
BROWN
Sir.
MR. MOON
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen
were inquiring about distinguished
individuals, and I was just this
very moment telling them that
Solomon Northup is an expert
player on the violin.
HAMILTON
He was indeed.
SOLOMON
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

BROWN
Taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty, may
we trouble you for a moment of
your time to converse, sir?
