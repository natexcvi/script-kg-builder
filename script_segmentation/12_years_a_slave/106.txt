INT. SLAVE SHACK  NIGHT

118  118
Slaves are crammed into the shack  LITERALLY ON TOP OF
EACH OTHER  as they try to sleep. Some lay, some sit
up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move
let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real
risk of suffocating in the mass. Some cough and wheeze.
A CHILD CRIES...
Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that
his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of
survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually
ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him
as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space
in the pen.
