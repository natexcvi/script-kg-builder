EXT. ROAD  DAY

Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.
He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the
store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When
he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens
it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he
folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up
the sack and continues on his way.
