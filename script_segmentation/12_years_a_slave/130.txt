EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD  DAY 144

With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
working the field picking cotton. As before they sing a
spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the
tedium at hand.
But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Uncle
Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the
ground.
Treach calls to Edward
TREACH
Get him water.
Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and
DUMPS ON HIM...BUT ABRAM DOES NOT RISE. DOES NOT MOVE.
At this point, the sounds of the singing from the others
tapers off as they realize Abram isn't getting up.
