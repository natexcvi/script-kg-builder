EXT. RIVER BANK  CONTINUOUS 74

Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the
river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO
DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing
waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a
thought far greater than relieving himself has come to
him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were
a man possessed.
