INT. NORTHUP HOUSE  NIGHT

Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in
each other's arms. Beyond being physically close,
emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with
one another. They are the very representation of a
couple who are made for each other.
They look at each other for a prolonged time.
SOLOMON 
COMICALLY FORLORN 
Three weeks. Two days. 
ANNE 
It is the custom. I wonder what 
you will do without me? 
SOLOMON 
I won't stay idle. 
SOLOMON's eyes lower. 
ANNE 
Darling, it's good money. 
SOLOMON 
If only I didn't have to share 
your cooking with other people. 
ANNE holds his gaze. 
ANNE 
You don't. 
They kiss.
