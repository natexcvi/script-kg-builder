EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/ADDITION  DAY

SEPTEMBER, 1852
SLOW 
To a now virtually complete, halfpainted white gazebo.
Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels
away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons
Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who
are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon
approaches, Bass shouts
BASS
And bring those markers!
Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and
approaches Bass.
BASS CONT'D
No letter yet.
SOLOMON
You are certain?
Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the
earth.
BASS
I have inquired thoroughly. More
than is safe for either of us.
Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground,
improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.
BASS CONT'D
Solomon...I have a job or two on
hand which will be completed
shortly... The work here has
grown sparse.

Bass doesn't need to spell things out for Solomon.
Solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation
should be very clear.
BASS CONT'D
You must know, wherever I am I
will press your cause.
SOLOMON
Five months. On top of these
years. No cause remains.
BASS
If there is any chance...
SOLOMON
Mr. Bass...
BASS
I will continue to write your
PEOPLE
SOLOMON
Go home knowing you have tried.
The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both
men. Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES
SOLOMON'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND
SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen
making contact with a slave. But in the strength of
their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold
each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.
