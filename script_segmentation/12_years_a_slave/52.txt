INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM  DAY

We come in on an odd sort of sight A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot  the room all
gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up  look
smart as he previously admonished them. They are made
to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
A buyer  WILLIAM FORD a man of middle age, and an
attractive nature in his tone of voice  consults a list
he's drawn up and asks of Freeman
FORD
What is the price for the ones
Platt and Eliza?
FREEMAN
A thousand for Platt he is a
nigger of talent. Seven hundred
for Eliza. My fairest price.
FORD
You will accept a note?
FREEMAN
As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
separated from her family. She begs of Ford
59  59
ELIZA
Please, sir... Please don't
divide my family. Don't take me
unless you take my children as
well.
FREEMAN
Eliza, quiet!
ELIZA
You will have the most faithful
slave in me, sir. The most
faithful slave that has ever
lived, but I beg that you do not
separate us.
A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman
and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall
BUYER
Your price for the child?
FREEMAN
You see how fit the boy is. Like
ripe fruit. He will grow into a
fine beast.
Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN  exhibiting
his activity and his condition.
FREEMAN CONT'D
Six hundred, and that's fair and
final.
BUYER
Done.
He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet,
counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the
already extended hand of Freeman.
Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza it visibly
touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.
FORD
How much for the little girl? You
have no need for her. One so
young will bring you no profit.
FREEMAN
I will not sell the girl. There's
heaps 'n piles of money to be made
off her. She is a beauty. One of
the regular bloods. None of your
thicklipped, bullet headed,
cotton picking niggers.

FORD
Her child, man. For God's sake,
are you not sentimental in the
least?
FREEMAN
My sentimentality stretches the
length of a coin. Do you want the
lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on
them all?
FORD
I will take the ones Platt and
Eliza.
Eliza grips her children tight.
ELIZA
I will not go without my children.
You will not take them from me.
59  3 59
As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza
and harshly kicks her away from Emily.
ELIZA CONT'D
Please, don't. No!
Freeman, to Cape
FREEMAN
Take her out of here.
Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward
the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do
not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS.
FREEMAN CONT'D
Keep her quiet.
Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza
continues to scream for her children as Emily does for
her mother.
EMILY
Mama... Mama!
FREEMAN
TO SOLOMON
Play something! Get the fiddle
and play.
As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to
play lightly.
FREEMAN CONT'D
Play!
Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is
barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets
the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing.
Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring
to be strong
EMILY
Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good
girl. Don't cry. I will keep my
head up and I will look smart. I
will always look smart.
FREEMAN
Make merry, all of you! Goddamn
it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it's
your damned hide I will take it
out of!
Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping
both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room
by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE.
