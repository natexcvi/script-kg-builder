EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION  LATER

Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. He looks
up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION. Epps
steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief.
As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from
where they are hanging their laundry to dry. Treach is
near as well.
EPPS
Run off. Run off, did you?
PATSEY
MASSA EPPS
EPPS
You miserable wench! Where you
been?
PATSEY
I been nowhere.
EPPS
Lies to your misdeeds!
PATSEY
The Sabbath day, Massa. I took me
a walk to commune wit da Lord.
EPPS
Bring the Lord into yer
deceptions? Yah Godless...
Shaw's. Comin' from Shaw's
plantation weren't yah?
106A.
156  156
PATSEY
...No...
156  2 156
EPPS
Yah took yerself ta pleasure Shaw.
Yah gave baser passion to that
unblushin' libertine!
Solomon tries to intervene
SOLOMON
MASTER EPPS
EPPS
Now yah speak? Now that yah want
to add to 'er lies yah find yer
tongue.
Epps goes to strike Solomon, but Patsey pulls his arm
back.
PATSEY
Do not strike him. I went to
Massa Shaw's plantation!
EPPS
Yah admit it.
PATSEY
Freely. And you know why.
Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress.
PATSEY CONT'D
I got this from Mistress Shaw.
Mistress Epps won't even grant me
no soap ta clean with. Stink so
much I make myself gag. Five
hundred pounds 'a cotton day in,
day out. More than any man here.
And 'fo that I will be clean that
all I ax. Dis here what I went to
Shaw's 'fo.
EPPS
You lie...
PATSEY
The Lord knows that's all.
EPPS
You lie!
PATSEY
And you blind wit yer own
covetousness. I don't lie, Massa.
If you kill me, I will stick ta
that.
EPPS
I will learn you to go to Shaw's.
Treach, go get some line.
156  3 156
Treach runs quickly to the tool shed. In short order he
returns with the rope in hand.
EPPS CONT'D
Strip her. Strike her bare 'n
lash her to the post.
Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She
gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction.
Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his
whip.
EPPS CONT'D
Yah done this to yerself, Pats!
Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no
matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the
blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating
and spurring him on.
MISTRESS EPPS
Do it! Strike the life from her.
Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand
ahead of the act... But he does not have it in him to
deliver such a beating. Turning to Solomon, thrusting
the whip at him
EPPS
Beat her.
Solomon doesn't move. Epps shoves the whip into his
hand.
EPPS CONT'D
Give her the whip. Give it all to
her!
Patsey, begging to Solomon
PATSEY
I had rather it you, Platt.
EPPS
Strike her, or yah will get the
same!
156  4 156
Solomon takes a step back. He unfurls the whip... He
begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms
before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too
distraught to watch.
But the Mistress... She is not satisfied with Solomon's
halfhearted effort.
MISTRESS EPPS
He pantomimes. There ain't barely
a welt on her. That's what your
niggers make of yah a fool fer
the takin'.
Epps's grief is replaced by fury. EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL
FROM TREACH'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves.
EPPS
Yah will strike her. Yah will
strike her until her flesh is rent
and meat and blood flow equal, or
I will kill every nigger in my
sight!
Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life.
But from the ground, from Patsey
PATSEY
Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I
am dead.
What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly
whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey
screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again...
After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is
not satisfied.
EPPS
Until I say no more! I ain't said
nothing!
Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as
promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE
THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD.
Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do
no more.
EPPS CONT'D
Strike her! Strike her!
Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips
Patsey with ten fold greater force than he had. The
painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and
dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases
struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.
156  5 156
Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die
away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying.
Solomon, screaming at Epps
SOLOMON
Thou devil! Sooner or later,
somewhere in the course of eternal
justice thou shalt answer for this
sin!
Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying
anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.
EPPS
No sin! There is no sin! A man
does how he pleases with his
property. At the moment, Platt, I
am of great pleasure. You be
goddamn careful I don't come to
wantin' to lightenin' my mood no
further.
By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in
the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the
foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign
everywhere.
Everywhere else.
Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the
Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back
into the house.
Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the
cabin.
