EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE CEMETERY  LATER A148

A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to
sing solo, Went down to the river Jordan. A response of
Oh Yeah quickly follows. Again the singer continues,
where John baptized three.
The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now
filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have
created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to
transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy
which has unyet been seen on screen. A joy which has
been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's
captivating, infectious.
This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the
audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the
seemingly chastising environment.
The singer continues, Well some say John was a Baptist,
some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher,
because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny. And
with that, the rest of the congregation chant I believe.
Oh, I believe.
