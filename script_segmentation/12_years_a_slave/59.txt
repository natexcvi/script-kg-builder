EXT. FORD PLANTATION  DAY

EARLY TO MID JUNE, 1841
It's Sunday morning. All of Ford's slaves are dressed
with their finest clothes  brightly colored and as
free as possible of defect. The slaves are gathered on
65  65
the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is
present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to
them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by
way of compassion.
FORD
But as touching the resurrection
of the dead, have ye not read that
which was spoken unto you by God,
saying, I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob. God is not the God of
the dead, but of the living. And
when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at his
doctrine. Then one of them, which
was a lawyer, asked him a
question, tempting him, and
saying, Master, which is the
great commandment in the law?
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind. This is the
first and great commandment. And
the second is like unto it, thou
shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself. On these two
commandments hang all the law and
the prophets.
Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope
in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE  SELFSECLUDED
A BIT  WEEPING GENTLY.
We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that
Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.
