INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM  EVENING

We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
that for the most part they are people of means.
The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
REEL.
The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
having cut directly from the tune he was previously
playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
way seems possessed with empty servitude.
Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
that despite their respective races there is much
admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.
