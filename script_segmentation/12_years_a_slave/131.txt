EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE CEMETERY  LATER

We are beyond the main of the plantation, the cotton
field in the background. We are at the slaves' cemetery,
a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground.
Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when
we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt. The
uncovered body of Abram lays near. Having dug down an
appropriate distance, the three men take the body and,
very unceremoniously, place it into the ground. Holding

the shovel in his hands, and resting it by his feet, Bob
tilts his head down and closes his eyes. The others do
the same. Almost stutteringly, not really knowing what to
SAY
BOB
I just want to say something about
Uncle Abram. He was a good man and
he always looked out for us since
we were little. God Bless him. God
love him. And God keep him.
That done, they begin to cover it with dirt. It is all
the more of a funeral that Abram will receive.
