INT. HOLD  NIGHT 48A 

The slaves are asleep. 
A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends 
down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her 
face. 
Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. 
From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt 
the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back 
at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the 
hold. 
As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand 
between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand 
to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says No you 
don't. 
Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. 
There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor 
and Robert, an impasse. 
We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile 
erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of 
incomprehension. 
Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that 
has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. 
The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. 
A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the 
floor like a sack of potatoes. 
Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror.
