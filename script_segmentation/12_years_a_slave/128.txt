EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK  NIGHT

We come in after the punishment has been dealt. Patsey
tends to Uncle Abram's back as Armsby applies liniments
to Solomon's. As he does, Armsby muses
ARMSBY
It's a tragedy. How does such
come to pass? Working a field and
picking cotton like a lowly hand.
I am of a damn sight better
station. And my desires never
lacked for a grandiose component,
though I will admit they have at
times been short on ingenuity.
But only at times. I have worked as
an overseer, you know.
SOLOMON
I did not, sir.
ARMSBY
Not sir. Just Armsby. Not owed
more than any other in the field.
I worked plantations from
Virginia, down into Alabama. I
could manage easy a hundred slaves
and have done so. But to toil in
the field? Never thought that
would come to pass. Never. But
times are desperate. Where once I
had said no to Epps and his
merger offerings, I returned cap

in hand. ...Look at what I have
become.
SOLOMON
How did you arrive at such a
place, if I may ask?
ARMSBY
Ask. It's just conversation.
From a pocket Armsby produces a flask.
ARMSBY CONT'D
I became a little too dependant on
the whisky, a little too
undependable on the job. Before
you say I am just a sorry drunkard,
let me state my case As reliable
employment as overseeing is, it's
no easy chore on the spirit. I
say no man of conscious can take
the lash to another human day in,
and day out without shredding at
his own self. Takes him to a
place where he either makes
excuses within his mind to be
unaffected... Or finds some way
to trample his guilty sensations.
Well, I trampled.
Armsby takes a drink.

And with frequency.
SOLOMON
Where is your place of birth?
ARMSBY
Maryland. Have you traveled
there?
SOLOMON
...I cannot say that I have.
ARMSBY
Fine country. More seasonal than
the bayou. A deal less humid.
SOLOMON
Why did you leave it?
ARMSBY
To make my fortune, of course. I
gave in to tales of wealth and
prosperity that were the lore of
the southern states all that's
needed being a patch of land and a
few good growing seasons. Cotton,

or tobacco. And then locating a
proper bank in which to store your
riches. But such profitable
outcomes are reserved for the
plantation masters. It's the lot
of the rest of us to serve. So I
settled on being an overseer, and
failed as well at that. In the
meantime my dreams gave way to
reality. Now, I want nothing more
than to earn a decent wage.
And get myself home.
Armsby takes another drink and leans back.
