EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA  DAY

Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as
Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making
rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.
SOLOMON
The creek is plenty deep enough to
sail, even with a boat full of
load. The distance from the WORK
AREA to the point on the latter
bayou is several miles by water
fewer than land. It occurs to me
that the expense of the
transportation would be materially
DIMINISHED
TIS
Materially diminished?
SOLOMON
If we use the waterway.
TIS
It's a scheme. Plenty of
engineers have schemed similarly.
The passes are too tight.
SOLOMON
I reckon them at more than twelve
feet at their most narrow. Wide
enough for a tub to traverse. A
team of niggers can clear it out.
TIS
And you know what of transport and
terra formin'?

SOLOMON
I labored repairing the Champlain
canal, on the section over which
William Van Nortwick was
superintendent. With my earnings
I hired several efficient hands to
assist me, and I entered into
contracts for the transportation
of large rafts of timber from Lake
Champlain to Troy.
FORD
TO TIS
I will admit to being impressed even
if you won't.
TO SOLOMON
Collect a gang, see what good you
can do.
