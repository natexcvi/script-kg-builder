EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/BACK PORCH  DAY

END OF JANUARY, 1842
From the back porch, we come into the scene on EDWIN
EPPS a repulsive and coarse man. His language gives
speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed
the advantages of an education.

Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them
altogether. ABRAM a tall, older slave of about sixty
years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married
to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD
and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though
in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She
is the offspring of a Guinea nigger, brought over to
Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant
sexuality.
MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits
with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH
THEM SHE IS VERY MOTHERLY. We also see Epps's overseer
TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.
Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone
of compassion with which Ford read.
EPPS
And that servant which knew his
Lord's will...WHICH KNEW HIS
LORD'S WILL and prepared not
himself...PREPARED NOT HIMSELF,
neither did according to his will,
shall be beaten with many
stripes... D'ye hear that?
Stripes. That nigger that don't
take care, that don't obey his
lord  that's his master  d'ye
see?  that 'ere nigger shall be
beaten with many stripes. Now,
many signifies a great many.
Forty, a hundred, a hundred and
fifty lashes... That's Scripter!
