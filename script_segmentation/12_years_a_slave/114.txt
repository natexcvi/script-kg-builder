INT. SLAVE SHACK  DAY A127A 

We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface. The 
tool moves on to form another mark. The sound is 
repetitive and almost unbearable. As we move out, we see 
the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo. They are engraved onto 
the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest 
his chin. 
Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips 
across the engraving. His face full of loss. 
Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning 
his head to the side as if to play.
