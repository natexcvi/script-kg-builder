EXT. WEAVING HOUSE  LATER

As the day gets on to midmorning, the sun already baking
in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even
before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of
belligerence out of sorts and something less than sober.
TIS
I thought I told yah ta commence
ta puttin' on clapboards this
morn'.
84  84
SOLOMON
Yes, master. I am about it. I
have begun on the other side of
the house.
Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is
picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.
TIS
Didn't I tell yah last night to
get a keg of nails of Chapin?
SOLOMON
And so I did and Chapin said he
would get another size for you, if
you wanted them when he came back
from the field.
Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward
Solomon with a great passion
TIS
Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed
somethin'!
Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in
no mood for Tibeats.
SOLOMON
I did as instructed. If there's
something wrong, then its wrong
with your instructions.
TIS
Yah black bastard! Yah goddman
black bastard!
In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza
to fetch a whip.
Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and
Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,
runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's
instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats
marches back whip in hand.
TIS CONT'D
Strip yer clothes!
Solomon does no such thing.
TIS CONT'D
Strip!
SOLOMON
I will not.
With concentrated vengeance, Tibeats springs for
Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and
84  2 84
raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike
the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,
Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A
violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
handle again and again and again.
TIS
Yew will not live ta see another
day, nigger! This is yer last, I
swear it!
Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's
wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
then pleas for mercy
TIS CONT'D
Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,
help me. God be merciful!
And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks
TIS CONT'D
Papa I am sorry!
Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers
a welldirected kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
ground.
CHAPIN
What is the matter?
Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of
dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on
SOLOMON
SOLOMON
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me.
CHAPIN
What's the matter with the nails?
With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats
says, as if being exposed
TIS
They are...they are too large.
CHAPIN
I am overseer here. I told Platt
to use them, and
MORE
84  3 84
CHAPIN CONT'D
I shall furnish such nails as I
please. Do you understand that,
Mr. Tibeats?
Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the
shaking of his fist.
TIS
This ain't done by half. I will
have flesh, and I will have all of
it.
Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He
looks around, not sure what to do to stay or to flee.
Anxiety mounts on his features.
A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles
his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to
fetch him.
Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is
visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
an air of impending trouble.
CHAPIN
Do not stir. Do not attempt to
leave the plantation on any
account whatever. But if you run
there is no protecting you.
SOLOMON
SIR
CHAPIN
If you run, Platt, there is no
protecting you. Rachel...!
Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a
distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log
kitchen.
Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is
to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we
continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the
unexpected mounts.
Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,
and he knows that death awaits him.
A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS
THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.
84  4 84
Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and
watches, but does not move to Solomon.
Solomon waits, and waits...
WE HEAR THE  OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.
He returns with two accomplices RAMSAY and COOK. They
carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.
TIS
Tha's the one. Tha's him.
Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
TIS  his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
it intensely palpable.
Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
verge of panic a man heading toward his own execution,
he begins to struggle and fight.
A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
life is choked from him.
With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
a pistol in each hand  Colt Paterson .36 caliber
Holster pistols with 9 barrels. Chapin moves with
determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and
matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't
need to be much more demonstrative.
CHAPIN
Gentlemen... Whoever moves that
nigger another foot from where he
stands is a dead man. I am
overseer of this plantation seven
years, and in the absence of
William Ford, my duty is to
protect his interests. Ford holds
a mortgage on Platt of four
hundred dollars. If you hang him,
he loses his debt. Until that is
canceled you have no claim to his
life.
Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook
84  5 84
CHAPIN CONT'D
As for you two, if you have any
regard for your own safety...I
say, begone!
Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols
Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without
further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.
TIS
Yah got no cause. Platt is mine,
and mine ta do with as I please.
Yah touch my property, I will 'ave
yah strung up as well.
Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment
as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He
chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the
neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the
DISTANCE
CHAPIN
Sam! Get the mule. You must ride
to Master Ford. Tell him to come
here at once without a single
moment's delay. Tell him they are
trying to murder Platt. Hurry,
boy. Bring him back if you must
kill the mule to do so!
SAM
Yes, suh!
Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much
speed.
