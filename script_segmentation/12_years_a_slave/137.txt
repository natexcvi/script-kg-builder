EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK  CONTINUOUS 153

Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the
shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,
Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to
his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from
a FLASK.
Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a
friend, and guides him into the woods.

letters and tries to get white
fellows to mail 'em.
Solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off.
EPPS CONT'D
Well, Armsby tol' me today the
devil was among my niggers. That
I had one that needed close
watchin' or he would run away.
When I axed him why, he said you
come over to him and waked him up
in the middle of the night and
wanted him to carry a letter to
Marksville. What have yah got to
say to that?
SOLOMON
All I have to say, master, is all
that need be said. There is no
truth in it.
EPPS
You say.
SOLOMON
How could I write a letter without
ink or paper? There is nobody I
want to write to 'cause I hain't
got no friends living as I know
of. That Armsby is a lying
drunken fellow. You know this,
just as you know that I am
constant in truth. Now, master, I
can see what that Armsby is after,
plain enough. Didn't he want you
to hire him for an overseer?
A beat.
SOLOMON CONT'D
That's it. He wants to make you
believe we are all going to run
away and then he thinks you will
hire an overseer to watch us. He
believes you are soft soap. He's
given to such talk. I believe
he's just made this story out of
whole cloth, 'cause he wants to
get a situation. It's all a lie,
master, you may depend on't. It's
all a lie.
For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps will go.
Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and
equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's
thoughts. In a low curse that clearly states his ill
intentions.

Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the
conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up
against Solomon's stomach. As Epps speaks, he closes it
and taps it on Solomon's shoulder.
EPPS
I am damned. I will be god... Were
he not free and white, Platt.
Were he not free and white.
Epps heads off. Solomon is left to exhale a deep breath.
