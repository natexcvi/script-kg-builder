EXT. CREEK  DAY

END OF JUNE, 1841
WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a
TEAM OF S working on the creek CHOPPING TREES
ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just
a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic
to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the
slaves go at it like they have got something to prove. And
rightly they do.
Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with
which he will transport the timber.
Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY SAILS THEM UP
THE CREEK WITH A TEST LOAD.
