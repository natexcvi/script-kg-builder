MID MAY, 1841
A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands
AND BELLOWS
RAY
Clemens...! Clemens Ray!
We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in
the young nation.
On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods
are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit
of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken
and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to
a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are
overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.
Two men  among many  are awaiting the arrival of the
Orleans. They are JONUS RAY  Clemens Ray's master  and
DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look
like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is
laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,
his master now represents freedom.

CLEMENS
...My master... Master Ray, sir!
Master Ray!
Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other
slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like
dominos.
RAY
Who is in charge of this vessel?
CAPTAIN
I am the Captain.
RAY
I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor
has documentation verifying that
the Negro named Clemens Ray is my
property.
As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis

RAY
You are ordered by court to return
that property immediately, or face
charges of thievery.
CAPTAIN
My duty is to transport goods. I
am not responsible for their
origin.
RAY
Remove these contraptions!
To his mate
CAPTAIN
Free him!
Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs
over his master as would a lost and then found child.
RAY
It's all well, now, Clemens. You
will return home with me.
to the Captain
Consider this notice and warning.

Ray, Davis and Clemens head away. Solomon seems both
desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray.
But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue
on  Clemens not so much as even looking back in
Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they
fade into the environs and are gone from sight.
