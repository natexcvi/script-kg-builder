EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE  MORNING 9

We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits
with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for
travel  Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver
loads bags into the carriage.
For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.
SOLOMON
Travel safely.
ANNE
Stay safely.
Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the
horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty
good bye to his wife and children.
