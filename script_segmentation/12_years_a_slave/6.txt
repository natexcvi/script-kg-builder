MARGARET
Will you read it again?
ANNE
Not just now, darling.
Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at
the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads
are bowed.
MARGARET
For food that stays our hunger,
For rest that brings us ease,
For homes where memories linger,
We give our thanks for these.
ALL
Amen.
SOLOMON
Margaret, that was wonderful.
MARGARET
Thank you, Papa.
SOLOMON
Alonzo, do you have something to
say?
ALONZO
Yes, I helped Momma make this.
ANNE
Yes, and you were such a good
help. Especially making the gravy.
MARGARET
Papa, I would very much like to
learn how to play the violin.
Could you teach me?
ALONZO
Me too!
MARGARET
Yes, but I asked Papa first.
SOLOMON
Both of you, calm down. We will
