EXT. TURNER PLANTATION  NIGHT

Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious
nature as he waits.
Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is
Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way
directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says
CELESTE
I am hungry.
Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She
opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats
CELESTE CONT'D
I was rude, and didn't even ask yo
name.
SOLOMON
Platt.
Solomon. Solomon is my true and
free name.
CELESTE
Was you free?
SOLOMON
I was. I am.
Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he
ANNOUNCES
SOLOMON CONT'D
I remain free in my heart.

Giving a laugh as though it's the silliest thing she's
HEARD
CELESTE
Free heart means nothin if'n yo
body gunna die a slave.
SOLOMON
I will not.
CELESTE
How? Celeste knows you ain't
gunna run. Celeste knows it ain't
your nature.
SOLOMON
I have a plan. I have a letter.
CELESTE
A letter? How will yah mail da
letter? Who yah trust to post it?
A nigger that can read and write
is a nigger that will hang.
There is a pause. Solomon can't answer this question. It
is the glaring hole in his plan.
Having finished eating

CELESTE CONT'D

night. You will bring her  amo
food.
SOLOMON

CELESTE
You will bring Celeste  amo food.
And with that Celeste again moves back into the darkness.
