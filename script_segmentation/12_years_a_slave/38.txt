EXT. NORFOLK/PORT  DAY 43A 

We see a flat overhead view of the port of Norfolk. 
Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the 
day's sun as if like silver pennies. A chain of slaves 
enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked 
vessel. 
MORE SLAVES  about 15 in all, of various genders and 
ages  are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT 
who fights viciously with his captors. With all haste 
is shoved down into the hold. 
Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, 
Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word 
spoken to Solomon or the others. 
With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the 
crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way 
again.
