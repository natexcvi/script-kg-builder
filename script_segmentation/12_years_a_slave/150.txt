EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE  DAY

MARCH, 1853
We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently
PARKER
Are you ready?
Solomon swallows and nods.
