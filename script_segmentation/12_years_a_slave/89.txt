EXT. ROAD  DAY

Solomon walks along a wellworn path, shopping bag draped 
over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly 
gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense 
foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees 
flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. 
The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, 
heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. 
The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is 
silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, 
preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's 
eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with 
a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose 
around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start 
barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of 
Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation. 
PATROLLER 
AGGRESSIVELY 
Boy, where are you going? 
SOLOMON 
almost tripping over 
HIS WORDS 
To the store, Sir, to 
Bartholomew's. I was sent there 
by Mistress Epps. 
The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around 
his neck, yanking him forward. He looks at it. 
PATROLLER 
Get there and get there quick. 
The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way. 
Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young 
men again there is a moment of connection. 
Solomon turns. The two men are hoisted up, kicking and 
spitting, behind his shoulder. 
Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards 
Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and 
68A.

trepidation. He walks, fighting to calm himself down. 
We move behind him as he continues his journey, a lonely 
figure.
