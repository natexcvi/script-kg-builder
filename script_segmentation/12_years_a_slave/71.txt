EXT. FORD PLANATION  DAY

END OF JANUARY, 1842 OVER ONE DAY
We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a
Weaving House that stands off to the side of the
plantation's Great House.
At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding. Tibeats
arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work.
TIS
Make them boards flush.
SOLOMON
They are, sir.
TIS
They is no such thing.
Solomon runs his hands over the boards.
SOLOMON
As smooth to the touch as a
yearling's coat.
TIS
Callin' me a liar, boy?
SOLOMON
Only a matter of perspective, sir.
From where you stand you may see
differently. But the hands are
not mistaken. I ask only that you
employ all your senses before
rendering judgement.
What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do
is spew invectives.
TIS
You are a brute. You are a dog,
and no better for followin'
instruction.
SOLOMON
I will do as ordered, sir.

TIS
Then you will be up at daybreak.
You will procure a keg of nails
from Chapin and commence puttin'
on clapboards.
Tibeats wheels away. Solomon goes back to his work.
After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in
the drive of the great house. It involves an
inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart
DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.
Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days
as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.
