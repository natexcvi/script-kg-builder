EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA  DAY 70

MID JUNE, 1841
The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked
meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon
reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.
SOLOMON
But he that is greatest among you,
let him be as the younger and he
that is chief, as he that doth
serve. For whether is greater, he
that sitteth at meat, or he that
serveth? Is not he that sitteth
at meat? But I am among you as he
that serveth.
A white customer  WINSLOW  irate at the sight and sound
of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the
Bible.
WINSLOW
From where did you thieve this?
SAM
Suh, the book is my property.
The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With
flailing hands he STARTS ING ON SAM. Solomon tries
to stop him. That only makes the situation worse,
Solomon now the target of the man's ire.
WINSLOW
Take your hands from me!
Ford comes running over.
FORD
What is the commotion?
WINSLOW
Your niggers are either brazen or
rebellious. This one was readin'
Scripture, and this one claims it
to be his.
FORD
It is. A gift from his Mistress.
WINSLOW
You condone this?
FORD
I encourage it. As a Christian I
can do no less.

WINSLOW
You can do no worse, Ford. A
slave that reads is dangerous.
Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford
WINSLOW CONT'D
And the man who would allow a
slave to read is unfit to own
niggers!
Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly
FORD
Pay him no mind. The word of God
applies to all. In that you may
take comfort.
