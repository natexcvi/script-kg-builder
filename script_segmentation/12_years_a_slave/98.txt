EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SMOKE HOUSE  NIGHT

On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house 
Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his
manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and
clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape
and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain
as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is
vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
Epps's frustration mounts until  as the Mistress Shaw
had cautioned  he crosses the line from passion to
violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
from her. When that fails, he punches her which only
leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,
Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep
breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left
him.
Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.
