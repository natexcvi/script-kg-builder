EXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN  LATER

Burch's stock arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are
led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE  a mulatto.
The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with
ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the
pen.
Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to
each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this
new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all
that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.
