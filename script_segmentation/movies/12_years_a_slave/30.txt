INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON  NIGHT 34

It's the deep of night, all are sleeping. A KEY TURNS IN
THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS. Burch enters with Radburn
beside him. Both carry LANTERNS with them. Hardly
giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves,
BURCH DEMANDS
BURCH
Come on. Get yer blankets. Get
up.
Sensing that things will not end well
ELIZA
No, please don't...
BURCH
I don't want to hear yer talk.
Get in the yard.
ELIZA
Please...
RADBURN
Ain't no need for all that.
Putting hand to Randall's head.
RADBURN CONT'D
Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all.
Don't want to frighten the
chil aren none over a li'l boat
ride, do yah?
Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative.
RADBURN CONT'D
Alright then. Git yerselves up.
