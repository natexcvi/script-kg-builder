INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK  NIGHT

A fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix
their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small
hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water,
placed in the fire and baked. When it is done brown
the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the
slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much
emotion about General Jackson.
UNCLE ABRAM
Hold my words General Jackson
will forever be immortalized. His
bravery will be handed down to the
last posterity. If ever there be
a stain upon raw militia, he
done wiped away on the eight of
January. I say da result a that
day's battle is of  amo importance
to our grand nation than any
occurrence 'fo or since. Great
man. Great man in deed. We all
need pray to Heavenly Father da
General reign over us always.
