INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE  NIGHT

DECEMBER, 1844
It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in
quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding
his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to
dance.
Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked
pastries. She sets them down on a table.
MISTRESS EPPS
A moment from the dancing. Come
sample what I baked for y'all.
The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,
file toward the tray reciting a chorus of Thank you,
Mistress. As Patsey moves toward the pastries
MISTRESS EPPS CONT'D
There will be none for you, Patsey.
Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,
however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming
MISTRESS EPPS CONT'D
Yah see that? Did yah see the
look of insolence she give me?
EPPS
Seen nothin' but her turn away.
MISTRESS EPPS
Are you blind or ignorant? It was
hot, hateful scorn. It filled
that black face. Yah tell me yah
did'n see it, then yah choose not
to look, or yah sayin' I lie.
EPPS
Whatever it was, it passed.
MISTRESS EPPS
Is that how yah are with the
niggers? Let every ill thought
fester inside 'em. Look at 'em.

MISTRESS EPPS CONT'D
They foul with it foul with their
hate. You let it be, it will come
back to us in the dark a night.
Yah want that? Yah want them
black animals to leave us gut like
pigs in our own sleep?
Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating.
It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue.
MISTRESS EPPS CONT'D
You are manless. A damned eunuch
if ever there was. And if yah
won't stand for me, I had pray you had
at least be a credit to yer own
kind and beat every foul thought
from 'em.
Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose.
She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE
PATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES.
FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN,
the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey
collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.
MISTRESS EPPS CONT'D
Beat it from 'em!
Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps
takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His
intentions are plain.
All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however,
displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others
MISTRESS EPPS CONT'D
Eat. Fill yourselves. ...And
then we dance.
The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.
