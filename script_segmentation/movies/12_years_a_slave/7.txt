INT. NORTHUP HOUSE  NIGHT 7

Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the
unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each
given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep,
Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.
Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his
arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the
simple, beautiful gift that is their children.
