EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD  DAY 30

It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in
by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.
The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years
old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in
education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who
answers to the name of Randall.
Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are
all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is
present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD
WATER. He throws water on the naked men.
RADBURN
Go on. Warsh up.
The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to
scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.
RADBURN CONT'D
The boy, too. Get him clean.
Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.
RADBURN CONT'D
Scrub now. Git 'em clean.
Solomon scrubs harder. Randall  clearly cold and
uncomfortable  appeals to Solomon.
RANDALL
Do you know when my Mama will
come?
RADBURN
Hush him up!
Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to
cry.
RANDALL
Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to
come?
Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain
ING
SOLOMON
Quiet, please.
Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.
RANDALL
Mama!
21A.

Saying anything to keep the boy quiet
SOLOMON
Your mother will come, I swear she
will, but you must be silent.
Please. Be silent!
On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall
goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws
water on the soapy men.
