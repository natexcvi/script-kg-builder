INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM  LATER 58

It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and
fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A
PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE  background music  as Freeman
tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes
less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his
livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a
good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better
of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the
slaves.
The business has the air of an etiquette class, though
what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
being more sellable. He works with them in groups of
five or so.
FREEMAN
Tallest to smallest, understand?
Are you taller than her? Then
you had go before her. Do it.
Move.
to the group
Keep your heads up. A sense of
direction that's how you look
smart. None of those saucer eyes.
Rid yourself of that smile. Look
like a goddamn grinnin' monkey.
Put the least thought in your
head. C amon, now. Think of
somethin'.
Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks
SOLOMON
Can you play a reel?
CAPE
DISMISSIVE
Nah. I don't know no reel.
SOLOMON
If I may...?
Cape looks to Freeman
FREEMAN
He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let
him play, boy. Let's see what he
can do.
Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers
stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he
warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.

THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG. SOME DANCE ALONG. All admire
his work. Freeman chief among them.
FREEMAN CONT'D
Keep on. Keep on.
Solomon continues to play.
FREEMAN CONT'D
A damn sight better than you,
Cape. A damn sight better.
Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on.
