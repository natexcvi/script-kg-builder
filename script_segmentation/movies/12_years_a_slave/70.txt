EXT. FORD PLANTATION  DAY 81

JANUARY, 1842
Seasons have passed. It is winter now, and very grey out
along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats  who we have seen
working around the WORK AREA  stand with Solomon,
Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much
lament.
TIS
Raise yer shirt.
Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon's
back, at the scars from lashings he bears.
TIS CONT'D
Troublesome.
FORD
He's a good carpenter and quick
witted.
TIS
I am familiar with his cleverness.
FORD
You won't find a nigger more
humble.
TIS
Ain't found a nigger yet I cain't
humble.
Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the
preceding.
SOLOMON
Sir, have I done something wrong?
FORD
Not your concern, Platt. I say
with much...shame I have compiled
debts. I have long preached
austerity, but find myself
hypocritical in that regard.
You will be in the ownership of Mr.
Tibeats. You are his now. Serve
him as you had serve me.
SOLOMON
Sir.
FORD
And your faithfulness will not be
forgotten.
81  81
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
FORD
Pride and want have been my sin.
Loss of you is but one of my
punishments.
