INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/ARMSBY'S SHACK  LATER 150

The door opens. Solomon enters. Armsby is surprised to
see him. So much so, he isn't sure what greeting to
give. Solomon gives a blunt introduction. Re the
COINS
SOLOMON
The proceeds of my fiddling
performances. A few picayunes,
but all I have in the world. I
promise them to you if you will do
me the favor I require. But I beg
you not to expose me if you cannot
grant the request.
ARMSBY
What do you ask?
SOLOMON
First, your word, sir.
ARMSBY
On my honor.
SOLOMON
It is a simple enough request. I
ask only that you deposit a letter
in the Marksville post office.
And that you keep the action an
inviolable secret forever. The
details of the letter are of no
consequence. Even at that, there
would be an imposition of much
pain and suffering were it known I
was the author. A patron is what
I require, sir.
ARMSBY
Where's the letter now?
SOLOMON
...It is not yet written. I will
have it in a day. Two at most, my
skill with composition as poor as
it is.
Armsby considers the request.
ARMSBY
I will do it. And will accept
whatever payment is offered.
Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he
can wholly give himself over to trust.

ARMSBY CONT'D
To assist you, I put my own self
at risk. I will do so, but fair
compensation is all I ask.
Solomon hands over the money.
ARMSBY CONT'D
Draw up your letter. We will meet
again. In two days?
SOLOMON
In two days. ...Thank you.
Solomon exits.
