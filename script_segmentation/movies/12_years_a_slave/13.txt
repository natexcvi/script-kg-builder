INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/STUDY  LATER 13

Solomon sits down to write a letter pen poised over
paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon
thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE
PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE. WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT
THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER
IS LOST ON SOLOMON. THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN
THE NEAR FUTURE.
