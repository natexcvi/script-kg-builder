EXT. FORD PLANATION/SLAVE SHACK  EVENING

END OF JULY, 1841
The slaves eat. All tired from a days work they conduct
themselves in silence. All except for Eliza who,
SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION, as always weeps. The
sound of her sobbing edging him up  particularly after
Master Ford's over the years observation. Solomon
FINALLY SNAPS
SOLOMON
Eliza. Eliza, stop!
Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza. She does not stop. As
if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZA
VIOLENTLY.
SOLOMON CONT'D
Stop it! Stop!
ELIZA
It's all I have to keeps my loss
present.
SOLOMON
You let yourself be overcome by
sorrow. You will drown in it.
ELIZA
Have you stopped crying for your
children? You make no sounds, but
will you ever let them go in your
heart?
SOLOMON
...They are as my flesh...

ELIZA
Then who is distressed? Do I
upset the Mistress and the Master?
Do you care less for my loss than
their well being?
SOLOMON
Master Ford is a decent man.
ELIZA
He is a slaver.
SOLOMON
Under the circumstances
ELIZA
Under the circumstances he is a
slaver! Christian only in his
proclamations. Separated me from
my precious babies for lack of a
few dollars. But you truckle at
HIS BOOT
SOLOMON
No...
ELIZA
You luxuriate in his favor.
SOLOMON
I survive. I will not fall into
despair. Woeful and crushed
melancholy is the yolk I see most.
I will offer up my talents to
Master Ford. I will keep myself
hearty until freedom is opportune.
ELIZA
Ford is your opportunity. Do you
think he does not know that you
are more than you suggest? But he
does nothing for you. Nothing.
You are no better than prized
livestock. Call for him. Call,
tell him of your previous
circumstances and see what it
earns you...Solomon.
Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to
underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet
he says nothing. Again, pointedly
ELIZA CONT'D
So, you have settled into your role
as Platt, then?
SOLOMON
DEFENSIVE
My back is thick with scars from

SOLOMON CONT'D
protesting my freedom. Do not
ACCUSE ME
ELIZA
I accuse you of nothing. I cannot
accuse. I too have done so many,
many dishonorable things to
survive. And for all of them I
have ended up here... No better
than if I had stood up for myself.
Father, Lord and Savior forgive
me... Forgive me. Oh, Solomon,
let me weep for my children.
FORD V.O.
At the same time came the
disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who
is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven?
