INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE  NIGHT

Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and
now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle
of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon
strikes up a tune Henry joins in with a pan flute and
the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of
it certainly more torture than pleasure.
Epps, whip in hand
EPPS
Where's yah merriment? Move yer
feet.
As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on
Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary
motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
Patsey twirl about the floor.
This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of
Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all
her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square
in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY
AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.
The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first
time they have seen as much from the Mistress.
Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion
MISTRESS EPPS
Sell her!
EPPS
C amon, now. Wha's this?
MISTRESS EPPS
You will sell the negress!
EPPS
You are talkin' foolish. Sell
little Pats? She pick with more
vigor than any other nigger!
Choose another ta go.
MISTRESS EPPS
No other. Sell her!
EPPS
I will not!

MISTRESS EPPS
You will remove that black bitch
from this property, 'er I will take
myself back to Cheneyville.
EPPS
Back to that hog's trough where I
found you? Oh, the idleness of
that yarn washes over me. Do not
set yourself up against Patsey, my
dear. That's a wager on which you
will not profit. Calm yerself.
And settle for my affection,
'cause my affection you got. Or,
go. 'Cause I will rid myself of
yah well before I do away with
her!
Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to
even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she
storms away.
For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey
sobbing.
EPPS CONT'D
That damned woman! I won't have
my mood spoiled. I will not.
Dance!
Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon
responds by playing.
Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor,
blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as
ordered, return to dancing.
