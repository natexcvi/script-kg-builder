EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD  DAY

Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is
conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon
works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he
normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a
matter of perspective Solomon's unease over his actions.
But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and
talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward
Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.
