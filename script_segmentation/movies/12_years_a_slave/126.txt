EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD  DAY 140

JULY, 1847
The slaves are out working on the field. White hands
appear, picking cotton ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at
picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job.
As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short
on selfmotivation. In anachronistic terminology, he had
be called a slacker. He joins in with the slaves,
singing a spiritual.
