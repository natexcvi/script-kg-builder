EXT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE  EVENING 123

Solomon waits outside the house on the porch. A house
servant  ZACHARY  approaches and admonishes Solomon.
ZACHARY
Off the porch. Get off.
Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down.
Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to
Solomon.
SOLOMON
...Sir...
JUDGE TURNER
Platt is it? Have you cultivated
cane previously?
SOLOMON
No, sir, I have not.
JUDGE TURNER
You take to it quite naturally.
Are you educated?

SOLOMON
Niggers are hired to work, not to
read and write.
Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives
Solomon a wary looking over.
JUDGE TURNER
You play the fiddle?
SOLOMON
I do.
JUDGE TURNER
Willard Yarney, a planter up the
bayou, celebrates his anniversary
in a three week's time. I will
hold out your name to him. What
you earn is yours to keep.
SOLOMON
Sir.
JUDGE TURNER
Mind yourself, Platt.
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
