EXT. WASHINGTON  DAY 18

The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace
is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for
the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black,
and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands
are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag
hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of
Harrison at varying locations.
Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown
RIDE ONWARD IN THEIR CARRIAGE.
