INT. SLAVE SHACK  NIGHT

Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and
pressed together.
As he tries to rest  sleep is nearly impossible 
Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.
She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact
with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be
unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened
by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes
no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.
Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely
stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand

to Solomon's. After a moment of seemingly reacquainting
herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES

SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon
tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her
breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act 
really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE
ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,
FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN
AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE
SOLOMON.
The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to
Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more
compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO
MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more
perfunctory than passionate.
We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
release. But more  or substantially less  than joyous
sex, it is really just a druglike inoculation against
reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that
remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna
turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is
as though the act had not happened at all.
