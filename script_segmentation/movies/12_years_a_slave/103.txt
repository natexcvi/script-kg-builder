INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK  NIGHT

We come up on the slaves who lay sleeping. All except
for Patsey. She rises from her bedding, goes to a corner
of the cabin and removes something from a secretive
location. She then moves over to Platt.
PATSEY
Platt... Platt, you awake?
SOLOMON
I am.
PATSEY
I have a request an act of
kindness.

Patsey displays what she took from hiding. It is a
LADY'S FINGER RING.
PATSEY CONT'D
I secreted it from the Mistress.
SOLOMON
Return it!
PATSEY
It yours, Platt.
SOLOMON
For what cause?
PATSEY
All I ask end my life. Take my
body to the margin of the swamp
Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane.
SOLOMON
No.
PATSEY
Take me by the throat. Hold me
low in the water until I's still
'n without life. Bury me in a
lonely place of dyin'.
SOLOMON
No! I will do no such thing.
The...the gory detail with which
YOU SPEAK
PATSEY
I thought on it long and hard.
SOLOMON
It is melancholia, nothing more.
How does such despair even come to
you?
PATSEY
How can you not know? I got no
comfort in this life. If I cain't
buy mercy from yah, I will beg it.
SOLOMON
There are others. Beg them.
PATSEY
I am begging you!
SOLOMON
Why? Why would you consign me to
damnation with such an unGodly
request?
114  2 114
PATSEY
There is God here! God is
merciful, and He forgive merciful
acts. Won't be no hell for you.
Do it. Do what I ain't got the
strength ta do myself.
Solomon says nothing. Clearly he's not about to do the
deed. With nothing else to do, knowing she is damned
with every breath she draws, Patsey crawls back to her
spot on the floor and lays herself down.
