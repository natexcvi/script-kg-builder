EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD  DAY

Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John
and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy
enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon
is still trying to apply reason to the situation.
22A.

Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he
calls out for his Mama. By now, however, his calls
should feel like little more than background noise.
SOLOMON
This can't stand. It is a crime.
I believe now someone lay in wait
for me. My drink was altered...
We are free men. They have...they
have no right to hold us.
Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give
none.
SOLOMON CONT'D
We need a sympathetic ear. If we
have an opportunity to explain our
SITUATION
CLEMENS
Who in your estimation is that
sympathetic ear?
SOLOMON
The two men I journeyed with. I am
certain they are making inquires at
this very moment.
CLEMENS
I would be just as certain they
are counting the money paid for
delivering you to this place.
SOLOMON
They were not kidnappers. They
were artists. Fellow performers.
CLEMENS
You know that? You know for
certain who they were?
32  2 32
The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain.
CLEMENS CONT'D
How I reckon the situation
whatever past we had...well,
that's done now. The reality to
come is us being transported
southward. New Orleans if I were
to venture. After we arrive,
we will be put to market. Beyond
that... Well, once in a slave
state I suppose there's only one
outcome.
JOHN
No.
CLEMENS
I don't say that to give you empty
agitation, John...
JOHN
For y'all. For y'all they ain't
nothin' but that! But John was'n
kidnapped. John bein' hold as
debt, tha's all. Massa pay his
debt, and John be redeemed
CLEMENS
Boy, our masters will not come for
us.
John is nearly beside himself with panic.
JOHN
Now John's...John's sorry for
y'all, but tha's how it be. Where
y'all goin', yah goin' witout
John. Massa take care of me.
Massa take care.
RANDALL
Mama!
All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall
doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is
Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties
ELIZA. She is arrayed in silk, with rings upon her
fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears.
Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has  to this
point  lived well. This is reflected in her airs and
her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin
color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's
half sister.
As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,
then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly
this is mother and child being reunited.

As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall.
She is overcome with emotion.
ELIZA
My darling. My sweet, sweet baby.
