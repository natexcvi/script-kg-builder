INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION / ADDITION  DAY 161

Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps
has told in the intervening.
BASS
How many years all told?
SOLOMON
Just nearly...just passed eleven.
BASS
Your story is...it is amazing, and
in no good way.
SOLOMON
Do you believe, sir, in justice as
you have said?
BASS
I do.
SOLOMON
That slavery is an evil that
should befall none?
BASS
I believe so.
SOLOMON
If you truly do, I would ask...I
would beg that you write my
friends in the north, acquainting
them with my situation and
beseeching them to forward free
papers, or take such steps as they
might consider proper to secure my
release.
Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a
prolonged beat.
SOLOMON CONT'D
My daughter Margaret is possibly
now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I
miss them so. It would be an
unspeakable happiness to clasp my
wife and my family again.
Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the
conversation by work. They both lift it toward the
floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

BASS
I have always forgone
relationships and family. I did
once have a sweetheart who I loved
deeply.
Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon
immediately hands over.
BASS CONT'D
But that was a long, long time
ago. I have been traveling this
country for the best part of
twenty years. My freedom is
everything. The fact that I can
walk out of here tomorrow gives me
most pleasure. I see the aching in
your eyes, the pain of not being
attached to your loved ones. My
life doesn't mean much to anyone,
but it seems your life means a lot
to a lot of people. What you have
just said to me scares me, and I
must say, sir, I am afraid. Not
just for you, but for me.
They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
Solomon, slightly confused.
BASS CONT'D
I will write your letter sir, for
if I could bring freedom to you,
it will be more than a pleasure.
It will be a duty. Now, would you
be so kind as to pass me those
nails, sir.
We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the
unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the
conversation had never occurred.
