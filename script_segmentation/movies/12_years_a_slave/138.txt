EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/WOODS  NIGHT

Having found a lonely spot, Solomon has struck a SMALL
FIRE. He has in his hand his letter. With no ceremony,
he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn.
And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever
being free. He stands and looks at it as if forever, as
ashes descend into the night sky.
