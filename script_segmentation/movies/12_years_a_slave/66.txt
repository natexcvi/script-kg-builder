EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA  LATER

Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks
just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their
manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.
Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber
winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally
applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just
been shown up after all.
