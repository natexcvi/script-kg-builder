EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION  DAY

MAYJUNE, 1847
We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps
stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits
as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way
wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
gathered.
The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully
returned.
EPPS
A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark
times is behind us. Clean livin'
'n prayer done lifted the plague.

EPPS CONT'D
As thick 'n white as New England
snow. 'N now my niggers is
returned to me.
TO SOLOMON
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.
Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?
Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.
Not on my land. Much work to do.
Days of old long since, eh?
Joyous! Joyous indeed!
Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey
who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE
HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms
display many new scars. It's clear that in the
intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
boy for Epps and the Mistress.
