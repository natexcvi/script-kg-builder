EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE  DAY B105

Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the
SHAW HOUSE.
As Solomon arrives
MASTER SHAW
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.
SOLOMON
Good morning, Master Shaw. I have
been sent by Master to retrieve
Patsey. May I approach?
MASTER SHAW
You may.
Solomon makes his way over to the piazza.
SOLOMON
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.
MISTRESS SHAW
Nigger Platt.
SOLOMON
My apologies. Patsey, Master
wishes you to return.
PATSEY
Sabbath day. I's free ta roam.
SOLOMON
Understood. But the Master sent
me running to fetch you, and said
no time should be wasted.
MISTRESS SHAW
Drink tea?
SOLOMON
Thank you, Mistress, but I don't
dare.
MISTRESS SHAW
Would you knowed Massa Epps's
consternation ta be any lessened
wit your timely return? Sit. Sit
and drink the tea that offered.
B105  B105
Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has
tea poured for him.
MISTRESS SHAW CONT'D
What'n was Epps's concern?
SOLOMON
...I had rather not say...
MISTRESS SHAW
L'il gossip on the Sabbath be
fine. All things in moderation.
Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as
diplomatic as possible.
SOLOMON
As you are aware, Master Epps can
be a man of a hard countenance.
There are times when it is
impossible to account for his
logic. You know he has ill
feelings toward your husband.
MISTRESS SHAW
He do.
SOLOMON
Master Epps has somehow come to
believe, as incorrectly as it may
be, that Master Shaw is... That
he is something of a lothario and
an unprincipled man. A misguided
belief born out of their mutual
competition as planters, no doubt.
MISTRESS SHAW
No doubt...if not born outta truth
itself.
The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the
conversation, waves back.
SOLOMON
I am certain Patsey's well being is
Master Epps's only concern.
MISTRESS SHAW
Nothin' Epps desire come outta
concern.
SOLOMON
I meant no disrespect.
MISTRESS SHAW
He ain't heard you.
B105  2 B105
SOLOMON
I meant no disrespect to you,
Mistress.
MISTRESS SHAW
Ha! You worry for me? Got no
cause to worry for my
sensibilities. I ain't felt the
end of a lash in  amo years than I
cain recall. Ain't worked a
field, neither. Where one time I
served, now I got others servin'
me. The cost to my current
existence be Massa Shaw
broadcasting his affections, 'n me
enjoyin' his pantomime of
fidelity. If that what keep me
from the cotton pickin' niggers,
that what it be. A small and
reasonable price to be paid 'fo
sure.
Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy
MISTRESS SHAW CONT'D
I knowed what it like to be the
object of Massa's predilections
and peculiarities. And I knowed
they can get expressed with
kindness or wit violence. A lusty
visit in the night, or a
visitation from the whip. And wit
my experience, if'n I can give
comfort, then comfort I give. And
you take comfort, Patsey the Good
Lord will manage Epps. In His own
time the Good Lord will manage dem
all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day
comin' that will burn as an oven.
It comin' as sure as the Lord is
just. When His will be done...the
curse on the Pharos is a poor
example of all that wait 'fo the
plantation class.
Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a
slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG
WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip
of her tea.
