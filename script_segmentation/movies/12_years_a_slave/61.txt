EXT. ROAD  DAY 72

Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to
Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it
ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings
the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road
ahead of them.
Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their usual dress of
buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic
colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them
DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a
deer.
The two groups stare at each other for a long moment.
