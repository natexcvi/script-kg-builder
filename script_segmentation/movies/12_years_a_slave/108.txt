EXT. CANE FIELDS  DAY

NOVEMBER, 1846
ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are
divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,
the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the
rows after.
Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves
with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he
displayed picking cotton.
Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.
