INT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/FOOD STORAGE  NIGHT

Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.
Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is
about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load
it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery
will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.
