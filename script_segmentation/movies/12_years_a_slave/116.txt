EXT. ROAD  NIGHT

His playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to
Judge Turner's on foot. There is only the moonlight with
which to light the way. As he walks, Solomon eats from a
HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from
the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the
brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of
the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.
SOLOMON
C amere. C amon, boy.

This time, there is no dog. Instead, from the dark and
the brush step TWO  MEN. Solomon stands. He looks
the men over  their clothes tatters and they themselves
covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not
just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.
At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.
Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.
Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is
attacked, TAKING A  THE ARM. Solomon fights back,
PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the
head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men
retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.
