INT. ORLEANS/HOLD  CONTINUOUS

The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark,
dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and RATS.
Burch comes around and checks the chains makes sure
they are all secure and locked.
Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold. Radburn follows.
Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.
Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if
wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure
of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and
Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of
Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them.
That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage
he cannot express in words.
