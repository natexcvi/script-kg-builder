INT. HOLD  LATER  DAY 45 

The hold is packed tighter now. 
Muzzle covering his face, Robert is shackled with his 
hands tied behind his back. Solomon and Clemens Ray look 
on. 
A sailor descends the staircase and takes off Robert's 
muzzle, shooting him a forbidding look. He leaves.

Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in midconversation. 
ROBERT 
I say we fight. 
Robert delivers this in a hushed voice. 
SOLOMON 
The crew is fairly small. If it 
were well planned, I believe 
they could be strong armed. 
CLEMENS RAY 
Three can't stand against a whole 
crew. The rest here are niggers, 
born and bred slaves. Niggers 
ain't got the stomach for a fight, 
not a damn one. 
ROBERT 
All I know, we get where we 
travelling we will wish we had died 
trying. 
CLEMENS RAY 
Survival is not about certain 
death, it is about keeping your 
head down. 
Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated  his voice now 
raised above the previous whispers. Grits his teeth. 
SOLOMON 
Days ago I was with my family, in 
my home. Now you tell me all is 
lost. Tell no one who I really 
am if I want to survive. I don't 
want to survive, I want to live.
