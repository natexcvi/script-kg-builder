INT. STORE  LATER

We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER a white man
and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him
WITH
SOLOMON
Mr. Parker.
PARKER
Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.
With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
about the store looking for items to purchase.
Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests
TO SOLOMON

PARKER
A year's passed? Off to Sandy
Hill?
ANNE
I am.
Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
from an upper shelf.
PARKER
Something to suit your style, but

ANNE
It's beautiful.
SOLOMON
CAUTIOUSLY
At what price?
ANNE
We will take it. Children, come
see what your father has just
purchased for me.
As the children run over  chattering excitedly about the

At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the

SOLOMON
Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris
and her children. I hope brighter
times ahead.

PARKER
Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
Now, may I interest you in a new
cravat? Pure silk by way of the
Before Parker can finish, the door opens. It's Jasper's
Master, FITZGERALD. He's stern, clearly displeased.
FITZGERALD
Jasper!
TO PARKER
My regrets for the intrusion.
SOLOMON
No intrusion.
Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as
though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a
response from a black man. Looking back to Parker
FITZGERALD
Good day, sir.
