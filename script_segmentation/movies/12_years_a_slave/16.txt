INT. PUB  LATER 16

After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon,
Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown
drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon
remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of
being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little
money was collected.
HAMILTON
Not an additional tip from a one
of them. They expect to be
entertained for nothing.
BROWN
And not satisfied a bit despite
giving them more than what they
paid for.
SOLOMON
It's the national mood. There's
too much grief to make room for
frivolity.
HAMILTON
My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
You were promised opportunity, and
you were given none.
BROWN
The opportunity is with the
circus. A two man show poorly
promoted, what were we to expect?
But the circus bills itself.
HAMILTON
True.
BROWN
I have told you of the circus with
which we are connected. Creatures
from the darkest of Africa.
Acrobats from the Orient who
SOLOMON
You have described it, yes.
BROWN
Yes. We need to return
immediately to Washington.
Solomon...I believe us familiar
enough now, but forgive me if I am
bold...would you consider making
the trip with us?
Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.

HAMILTON
Entertaining at pubs and inns has
it's place, but a man of your
skills deserves better.
BROWN
Hear, hear.
HAMILTON
And more importantly you would
build your own name and following.
The circus tends to attract those
with the highest of reputations.
An introduction here and there
could amount to a lifetime of
reward. Now would be the time.
With your family away, an
opportunity presents itself.
BROWN
Said as fellow artists as well as
businessmen. Well worth the
effort at least.
SOLOMON
You present a flattering
representation. As my family will
be traveling back shortly, perhaps
I might commit only to one trial
engagement.
HAMILTON
Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I
cannot recall being so excited.
BROWN
There is a practical concern. If
you are to continue on with us you
should obtain your free papers.
SOLOMON
Not necessary.
BROWN
Here in New York, no. But we will
be entering slave states and as a
matter of precaution... It's to
all our benefit we should not have
to come to account for your well
being.
HAMILTON
Six shillings worth of effort
could well save much trouble
later.

BROWN
We will go to the Customs House in
the morning, then travel on. Good
business all around.
