INT. ORLEANS/HOLD  LATER  NIGHT 43 

Down in the hold the slaves eat, pray. The MULATTO WOMAN
moves among them, catching ELIZA's eye.
MULATTO WOMAN
Cheer up and don't be so cast
down.
Clemens Ray and Solomon watch as the Mulatto Woman
returns to top deck, the trapdoor locked firmly behind 
her. Clemens Ray turns to Solomon with a deadpan stern 
expression. 
CLEMENS RAY 
If you want to survive, do and say 
as little as possible. Tell no 
one who you really are and tell no 
one that you can read and write.

Clemens Ray turns away from Solomon, eyes lost into the 
distance. 
CLEMENS RAY CONT'D 
SLOWLY 
Unless you want to be a dead 
nigger. 
Solomon's face is one of a confused despair.
