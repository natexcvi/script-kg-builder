They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of
the plantation  the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly
called  is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in
front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry
house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The
plantation is described as a green spot in the
wilderness.

activity  the excitement of a new delivery. MR.
CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM.
