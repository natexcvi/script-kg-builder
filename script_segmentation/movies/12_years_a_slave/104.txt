EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD  DAY

JULY, 1846
Hard times on the planation. Where previously the field
in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and
under grown.
The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but
rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms
have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.
We see the cotton worms in extreme closeup, moving among
and destroying the cotton crop.
Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined
field.
EPPS
It is a plague.
TREACH O.S.
Cotton worm.
EPPS

Two season God done sent a plague
to smite me. I am near ruination.
Why, Treach? What I done that God
hate me so? Do I not preach His
word?
TREACH O.S.
The whole Bayou sufferin'.
EPPS
I don't care nothin' fer the damn
Bayou. I am sufferin'.
Epps looks among his slaves at work, his enmity growing.

brought this on me. I bring 'em

EPPS CONT'D
God's word, and heathens they are,
they brung me God's scorn.
Crazed, Epps runs into the field, taking himself from
slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay
his hands on.
EPPS CONT'D
Damn you! Damn you all! Damn
you!
