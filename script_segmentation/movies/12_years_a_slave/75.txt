EXT. FORD PLANATION  LATER 87

Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in
sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips
dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may
very well expire before the day is over.
Eventually Rachel comes over  timidly, and as though she
were acting contrary to orders  and offers a drink of
water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for
him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the
water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,
and leaves Solomon to hang.
