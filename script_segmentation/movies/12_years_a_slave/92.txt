EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE  DAY 104

JULY, 1844
Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea
with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A  WOMAN. Though
once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not
wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with
white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER.
It makes for a tranquil surreal scene.
MASTER SHAW, A WHITE MAN, IS ON THE LAWN GROOMING A
HORSE.
