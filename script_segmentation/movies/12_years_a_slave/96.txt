EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD  DAY

AUGUST, 1844
With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A
SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the
tedium at hand.
But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry
begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse
right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,
none move to help him. None dare.
From Treach rather matter of factly
TREACH
Get him water.
Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry,
DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY
ANYTHING TO DRINK.
Roused, Henry rights himself.
EDWARD
Go'won. Git up.
Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking
cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the
song is all that can keep him going.
