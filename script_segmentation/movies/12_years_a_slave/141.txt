EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION  DAY

It's the Sabbath. The slaves are left to themselves to
do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are
washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their
clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry
near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It
is a sight of ritual. Missing from the field of labor is
Patsey, for whom Epps hollers.

Where she gone?
The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to
say. They don't know where she is. Eventually Epps
drops into true sorrow.
EPPS CONT'D
She gone... My Pats gone.
