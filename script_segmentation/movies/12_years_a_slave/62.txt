EXT. FIELD  DUSK/END OF DAY

The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled.
They break bread  actually they work on the carcass of
the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As
well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an INDIAN
FIDDLE. The Chickasaws perform a customary dance
trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a
guttural, singsong noise.
The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon
particularly taken by the music...if not entirely
enthralled by it.

After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the
group.
