EXT. TURNER PLANTATION  NIGHT

Outside of the slave shacks Solomon's wound tended by
Uncle Abram. As he works on it
UNCLE ABRAM
Runaways I would expect. The
Bayou full with 'em. They nothin'
 amo dangerous than a nigger in
flight.
SOLOMON
They acted out of desperation.
UNCLE ABRAM
Act outta lunacy. Heads fulla
stories 'bout life up north. Yah
ever been north, Platt?
SOLOMON
...No...
UNCLE ABRAM
And never should yah be. I hope
that yah never bear witness the
sorry condition of the northern
black. Got neither no purpose,
nor direction. They jus...they
jus fall about the streets in
search of sustenance of both body
and spirit.
SOLOMON
You know this to be so?
UNCLE ABRAM
Two of my massas tolt me.
