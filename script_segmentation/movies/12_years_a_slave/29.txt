INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON  EVENING

Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with
Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza
drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon
who lends a sympathetic ear.
Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement
ELIZA
When I say I had my master's
favor, you understand. Above even
his own wife, I had it. Do you
know that he built a house for me?
Built it on the sole condition
that I reside there with him. The
added promise in time I would be
emancipated. And for nine years
he blessed me with every comfort
and luxury in life.
Displaying the finery she still wears
ELIZA CONT'D
Silks and jewels and even servants
to wait upon us. Such was our
life, and the life of this
beautiful girl I bore for him.
But Master Berry's daughter...she
always looked at me with an unkind
nature. She hated Emily no matter
she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
As Master Berry's health failed,
she gained power in the household.
Eventually, I was brought to the
city on the false pretense of our
free papers being executed. If I
had known what waited to be sent
south? I swear I would not have
come here alive.
