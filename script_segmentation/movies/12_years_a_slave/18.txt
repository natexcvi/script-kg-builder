INT. GADSBY HOTEL/DINNING ROOM  EVENING

A decent though crowded, boisterous and smokefilled
joint. Very lively. Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are
among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar. As
with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes
accessorize the background. Brown counts out 43.00 IN
COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the
amount.
BROWN
Fortythree dollars. All to you.
SOLOMON
That...it's far more than my wages
amount to.
BROWN
Consider the remainder an advance
from the circus. I cannot tell
you...I honestly wish you had seen
the expression of our director
when I described your abilities.
He was fairly overcome with
excitement.
HAMILTON
You should have invited him to sup
with us.
BROWN
I did. I did, but so many
preparations before the company is
to depart.
SOLOMON
GENTLEMEN
BROWN
Tomorrow we shall prepare for our
Washington debut. But tonight, our
thoughts are with the great man

BROWN CONT'D
for whom this city prepared solemn
memorial. He has passed from the
praise of men to receive the
plaudit of his heavenly father. A
fine man has passed. Let us
remember him with a drink.

Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their tankards to drink.
Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same.
HAMILTON
Cheers.
BROWN
Another. Our departed President
deserves all the salutation we can
imbibe.
Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well.
