I/E. CART  LATER 54

Solomon is carted off along with the rest of Burch's
stock Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.
As they move off from the port in a makeshift cart, it
opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage 
herded like cattle, chained together as if in a chain
gang. Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars 
THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
UNTREATED  brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A
CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER
PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE
NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people
being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of
oppression in place.
