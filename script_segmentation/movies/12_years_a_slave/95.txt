EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION  LATER

Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw's. Waiting on
the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for
Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious.

EPPS
Pats...! Patsey!
SOLOMON
Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.
Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and
moves toward the pair in a rage.
EPPS
Patsey...!
Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off
as Patsey continues on. Playing up his ignorance of
THE SITUATION
SOLOMON
Found her, Master, and brought her
back just as instructed.
EPPS
What had you jus now tell her?
What had you say to Pats?
SOLOMON
No words were spoken. None of
consequence.
EPPS
Lie! Damned liar! Saw you
talkin' with 'er. Tell me!
SOLOMON
I cannot speak of what did not
occur.
Epps grabs Solomon.
EPPS
I will cut your black throat.
Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE
PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around
the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,
however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as
speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can
even get close to the slave.
Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety

EPPS CONT'D
Platt... Platt, liquor filled me.
I admit that it did, and I done
over reacted. It's the Lord's
day. Ain't nothin' Christian in
us carryin' on like this. Help me
ta my feet, and let us both pray
to the Lord for forgiveness.
Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon
moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within
striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases
Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
drops down. And again offering a treaty
EPPS CONT'D
I am all done in, Platt. I have
met my limitations, and I ain't
equal to 'em. I concede to yah,
but in the name of valor, help yer
master to his feet.
Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is
attacked by Epps  this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is
too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade  and
chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE
PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING. A CHANGE
OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY BLEAKNESS OF SLAVE
LIFE.
Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair.
MISTRESS EPPS
What? Wha's the fuss?
SOLOMON
A misunderstanding is all. It
began when I was sent to retrieve
Patsey from where she had taken
sabbatical at Master Shaw's. Upon
returning, Master Epps believed
Patsey and me to be in
conversation when we were not. I
tried to explain, but it lead to
all this.
MISTRESS EPPS
What is it? Ya cain't remain the
Sabbath without her under your
eye? Ya are a noaccount bastard.
EPPS
Hold a moment...
MISTRESS EPPS
A filthy, godless heathen. My bed
is too holy for yah ta share.
105  3 105
EPPS
Wha's...wha's he been tellin' yah?
MISTRESS EPPS
Of yer misbegotten ways.
EPPS
And he would know what of
anythin'? I ain't even spoken
with him today. Platt, yah lyin'
nigger, have I? Have I?
Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains
silent.
EPPS CONT'D
There there's all the truth he
got. Damned nigger. Damn yah.
Epps pushes his way past the Mistress.
