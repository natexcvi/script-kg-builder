INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM  MORNING

It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
ANNE Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
see also the Northup children MARGARET who is eight, and
ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,
3  3
she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
preparing to pose for a portrait.
They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
greatest accomplishment a family that is healthy and
well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.
