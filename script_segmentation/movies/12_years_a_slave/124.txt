EXT. TURNER PLANTATION  NIGHT

Solomon sits with Celeste. He relates his news to her.
SOLOMON
I have my letter.
CELESTE
Yah has your freedom then?
SOLOMON
All that remains is to contrive
measures by which the letter can
safely be deposited in the post
office.
When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy.

CELESTE
I have resolved to return to my
Massa.
Solomon gives an unnerved look. This is not good news.
SOLOMON
Is it more food you need?
CELESTE
I live in fear.
SOLOMON
None will come after you in the
swamps.
CELESTE
It ain't the patrollers I scared
of... At all seasons the howling
of wild animals can be heard at
night along the border of the
swamps. At first their calls were
welcomin'. Dey too was free, 'n I
thought dey greeted me like a
sistah. Lately, dey cries have
turned horrifyin'. They mean to
kill Celeste.
SOLOMON
The solitude plays tricks. It's
your impression, nothing more. If
you go back to your master you
could face the same.
CELESTE
My freedom been nothin' but a
daydream. So was Celeste's
thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in
the bayou.
SOLOMON
Better the loneliness. You have
been free most of the summer.
Return now and your master will
make example of you.
CELESTE
It is lonely dwellin' waiting for
others who won't never come.

SOLOMON
Go north. Make your way by
night...
CELESTE
It will only be worse if'n Celeste
don't go back of her own will.
SOLOMON
You won't be caught. The dogs
won't track you. You are...you
are unique. Celeste...
CELESTE
You got alternatives, Solomon.
SOLOMON
To return is to die!
CELESTE
Celeste got no one to write a
letter to.
As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more
Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into
the swamp after her.
SOLOMON
Celeste... Celeste!
Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the
dark night and murky waters.
SOLOMON CONT'D
Celeste, I will guide you north!
Wait, and I will take you.
Celeste is too nimble. She outpaces Solomon, continues
on and disappears into the night.
SOLOMON CONT'D
Let me take you! Let me go with
you!
Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. He stumbles
around disoriented, calling into the blackness
SOLOMON CONT'D
Celeste...
Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds
and echoes  some in the distance, some perhaps moving
closer  which, moment by moment, become more and more
frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite
literally over his head the water first chest deep, then
neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to
guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to
crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way
138  3 138
back to shore. No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon
calls to her  desperately  for assistance.
SOLOMON CONT'D
Celeste! Come to me, Celeste!
In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly
done that he will not find land, nor aid and that this
is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible.
It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or
maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he
reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling
himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses
in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste
never to be seen again.
