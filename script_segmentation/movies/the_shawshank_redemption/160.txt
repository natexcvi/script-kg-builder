 NORTON'S OFFICE  DAY 1966 192
NORTON 
Well. I have to say, that's the 
most amazing story I ever heard. 
What amazes me most is you were 
taken in by it. 
ANDY 
Sir? 
NORTON 
It's obvious this fellow Williams 
is impressed with you. He hears 
your tale of woe and quite 
naturally wants to cheer you up. 
He's young, not terribly bright. 
Not surprising he didn't know what 
a state he had put you in. 
ANDY 
I think he's telling the truth. 
NORTON 
Let's say for a moment Blatch does 
exist. You think he had just fall to 
his knees and cry, Yes, I did it! 
I confess! By all means, please add
a life term to my sentence! 
ANDY 
It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's 
testimony, I can get a new trial. 
NORTON 
That's assuming Blatch is even 
still there. Chances are excellent 
he had be released by now. Excellent.
ANDY 
They had have his last known address.
Names of relatives... 
Norton shakes his head
Well it's a chance. isn't it? How
can you be so obtuse? 
NORTON 
What? What did you call me? 
ANDY 
Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The 
country club will have his old time
cards! W2s with his name on them! 
NORTON 
rises 
Dufresne, if you want to indulge 
this fantasy, that's your business.
Don't make it mine. This meeting's 
over. 
ANDY 
Look, if it's the squeeze, don't 
worry. I had never say what goes on 
in here. I had be just as indictable 
as you for laundering the money! 
NORTON 
Don't you ever mention money to me 
again, you sorry son of a bitch! 
Not in this office, not anywhere! 
slaps intercom 
Get in here! Now! 
ANDY 
I was just trying to rest your mind
at ease, that's all. 
NORTON 
as GUARDS enter 
Solitary! A month! 
Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming 
ANDY 
What's the matter with you? It's my 
chance to get out, don't you see 
that? It's my life! Don't you 
understand it's my life?
