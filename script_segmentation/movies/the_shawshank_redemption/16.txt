INT  CELLBLOCK FIVE  NIGHT  17
 CELLBLOCK FIVE  NIGHT 1947 17
Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. 
Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying 
their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them 
with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are 
shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. 
RED V.O. 
The first night's the toughest, no 
doubt about it. They march you in 
naked as the day you are born, fresh 
from a Bible reading, skin burning 
and halfblind from that delousing 
shit they throw on you... 
Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, 
cigarette dangling from his fingers. 
RED V.O. 
...and when they put you in that 
cell, when those bars slam home, 
that's when you know it's for real. 
Old life blown away in the blink of 
an eye...a long cold season in hell 
stretching out ahead...nothing 
left but all the time in the world 
to think about it. 
Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few 
others being brought up to the 2nd tier. 
RED V.O. 
Most new fish come close to madness 
the first night. Somebody always 
breaks down crying. Happens every 
time. The only question is, who's 
it gonna be? 
Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. 
RED V.O. 
It's as good a thing to bet on as 
any, I guess. I had my money on 
Andy Dufresne...
