 PRISON LIBRARYANDY'S OFFICE  DAY 1954 103
Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find 
Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a 
chokehold and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified. 
JIGGER 
C amon, Brooksie, why don't you just 
calm the fuck down, okay? 
BROOKS 
Goddamn miserable pukeeatin' sons 
of whores! 
He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air. 
RED 
What the hell's going on? 
SNOOZE 
You tell me, man. One second he was 
fine, then out came the knife. I 
better get the guards. 
RED 
No. We will handle this. Ain't that 
right, Brooks? Just settle down and 
we will talk about it, okay? 
BROOKS 
Nothing left to talk about! It's all 
talked out! Nothing left now but to 
cut his fuckin' throat! 
RED 
Why? What's Heywood done to you? 
BROOKS 
That's what they want! It's the 
price I gotta pay! 
Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly 
ANDY 
Brooks, you are not going to hurt 
Heywood, we all know that. Even 
Heywood knows it, right Heywood? 
HEYWOOD 
nods, terrified 
Sure. I know that. Sure. 
ANDY 
Why? Ask anyone, they will tell you. 
Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man. 
RED 
cuing nods all around 
Yeah, that's right. That's what 
everybody says. 
ANDY 
You are not fooling anybody, so just 
put the damn knife down and stop 
scaring the shit out of people. 
BROOKS 
But it's the only way they will let 
me stay. 
Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers
free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red.
Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs.
ANDY 
Take it easy. You will be all right. 
HEYWOOD 
Him? What about me? Crazy old 
fool! Goddamn near slit my throat! 
RED 
You have had worse from shaving. 
What had you do to set him off? 
HEYWOOD 
Nothin'! Just came in to say 
faretheewell. 
off their looks 
Ain't you heard? His parole came 
through! 
Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to 
understand. Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his
arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly 
RED 
Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be 
long till you are squiring pretty 
young girls on your arm and telling 
'em lies.
