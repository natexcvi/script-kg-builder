INT  ANDY'S TUNNEL  DAY  252
 FIELD  NIGHT 1966 251
Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile 
distant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the 
mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. 
RED V.O. 
Five hundred yards. The length of 
five football fields. Just shy of 
half a mile. 
Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavygauge wire mesh 
covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the 
darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, 
pushes himself out, and plunges headfirst into the creek. He 
comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waistdeep. 
He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets 
his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 
the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 
feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A 
FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon.
