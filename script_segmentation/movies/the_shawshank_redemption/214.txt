EXT  SHAWSHANK PRISON  WIDE SHOT  DAY  257
 SHAWSHANK PRISON  DAY 1966 256
Norton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning 
paper in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into 
his office. Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk. 
The headline reads CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK. 
Below that, the subheadline D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments 
Expected. Norton looks up as SIRENS SWELL in the distance.
