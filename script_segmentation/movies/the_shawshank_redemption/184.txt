INT  ANDY'S CELL  DAY  220
 ANDY'S CELL  DAY 1966 220
Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up 
into a fine rage 
NORTON 
What do you mean he just wasn't 
here? Don't say that to me, Haig! 
Don't say that to me again! 
HAIG 
But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! 
NORTON 
I can see that, Haig! You think I am 
blind? Is that what you are saying? 
Am I blind, Haig? 
HAIG 
No sir! 
Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley. 
NORTON 
What about you? You blind? Tell me 
what this is! 
HADLEY 
Last night's count. 
NORTON 
You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! 
Right there, see? Dufresne. He 
was in his cell at lights out! 
Stands to reason he had still be here 
this morning! I want him found! Not 
tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! 
Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red. 
NORTON 
Well? 
RED 
Well what? 
NORTON 
I see you two all the time, you are 
thick as thieves, you are! He 
must'a said something! 
RED 
No sir, he didn't! 
Norton spreads his arms evangeliststyle, spins slowly around.
NORTON 
Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and 
vanished like a fart in the wind! 
Nothin' left but some damn rocks on 
the windowsill and that cupcake on 
the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she 
knows! What say there, Fuzzy 
Britches? Feel like talking? Guess 
not. Why should you be different? 
Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they are nervous. 
Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at
the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words
NORTON 
It's a conspiracy! SMASH That's 
what this is! SMASH It's one big 
damn conspiracy! SMASH And 
everyone's in on it! SMASH 
Including her! 
He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. 
No smash. 
It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The 
rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster 
where her navel used to be. 
You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger 
into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand 
disappears into the wall.

as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces 
peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long 
crumbling tunnel in the wall.
