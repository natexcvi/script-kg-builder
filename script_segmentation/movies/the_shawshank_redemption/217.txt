INT  NORTON'S OFFICE  DAY  260
 PRISON  DAY 1966 259
Police cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle
for position. A colorless DISTRICT ATTORNEY steps forward into
UP, flanked by a contingent of S.ATE TROOPERS. 
D.A. 
Byron Hadley? 
D.A. 
You have the right to remain 
silent. If you give up that 
right, anything you say will be 
used against you in court... 
TROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The
D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face
scrunches up. He begins to cry. 
RED V.O. 
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear 
Byron Hadley was sobbing like a 
little girl when they took him away. 
Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up
toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow.
