 PRISON YARD  
VOICE over P.A. 
Report to your cellblocks for 
evening count. 
BOOM DOWN to Red and the boys. Convicts drift past them.

Where the hell is he? 
HEYWOOD 
Probably still up in the warden's. 
TOWER GUARD

YOU MEN! YOU HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT 
OR ZUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND? 
SKEET 
Christ. What do we do? 
FLOYD 
Nothing we can do. Not tonight. 
HEYWOOD 
Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all 
of us. Have a word with him. Ain't 
that right, Red? 
RED 
unconvinced 
Yeah. Sure. That's right.
