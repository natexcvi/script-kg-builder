INT  PLYMOUTH  NIGHT  3
 PLYMOUTH  NIGHT 1946 3
ANDY DUFRESNE, mid20's, wire rim glasses, threepiece suit. 
Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen hardly
dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far 
from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A 
cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are 
riveted to the bungalow up the path. 
He can hear them fucking from here. 
He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio 
plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him 
You stepped out of a dream... 
You are too wonderful... 
To be what you seem... 
He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully 
 revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. 
He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over 
the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, 
loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 
Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. 
He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant 
lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 
opens the door and steps from the car.
