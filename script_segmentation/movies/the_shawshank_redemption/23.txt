 FATASS' CELL  NIGHT 1947 27
FatAss is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. 
HEYWOOD O.S. 
This ain't such a bad place. I will 
introduce you around, make you feel 
right at home. I know some big ol' 
bull queers who had love to make your 
acquaintance...especially that big 
white mushy butt of yours... 
And that's it. FatAss lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair 
FATASS 
OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I 
WANNA GO HOME!
