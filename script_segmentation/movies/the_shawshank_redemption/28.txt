 MESS HALL  MORNING 1947 32
Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on
his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and 
discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go 
by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. 
Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses
a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their 
stares, he picks up his spoon  and pauses, seeing something
in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 
It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's
a senior citizen, a longstanding resident. 
BROOKS 
You gonna eat that? 
ANDY 
Hadn't planned on it. 
BROOKS 
You mind? 
Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling
it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. 
BROOKS 
Mmm. Nice and ripe. 
Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and 
feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
Andy breathes a sigh of relief. 
BROOKS 
Jake says thanks. Fell out of his 
nest over by the plate shop. I am 
lookin' after him till he's old 
enough to fly. 
Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.
JIGGER 
Oh, Christ, here he comes. 
HEYWOOD 
Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. 
You know why it's fine? 
Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out
cigarettes and handing them down. 
HEYWOOD 
That's right, send 'em all down. I 
wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 
pretty as a chorus line. 
An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales
deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture. 
FLOYD 
Smell my ass... 
HEYWOOD 
Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your 
horse comin' in last and all. 
Hell, I sure do love that horse of 
mine. I believe I owe that boy a 
big sloppy kiss when I see him. 
RED 
Give him some'a your cigarettes 
instead, cheap bastard. 
HEYWOOD 
Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 
this week? How's that winnin' horse 
of mine, anyway? 
TYRELL 
Dead. 
the men fall silent 
Hadley busted his head pretty good. 
Doc already went home for the 
night. Poor bastard lay there till 
this morning. By then... 
He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence
mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly
ANDY 
What was his name? 
HEYWOOD 
What? What had you say? 
ANDY 
I was wondering if anyone knew his 
name. 
HEYWOOD 
What the fuck you care, new fish? 
resumes eating 
Doesn't matter what his fuckin' 
name was. He's dead.
