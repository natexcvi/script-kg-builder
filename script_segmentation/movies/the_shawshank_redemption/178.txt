 ANDY'S CELL  NIGHT 1966 213
Andy is polishing a chess piece. 
VOICE O.S. 
Lights out! 
The lights bump off. He finishes polishing, holds up the piece 
to admire. A pawn. He sets it down with the others  and we 
realize it's the final glance for the board. A full set. 
He gazes up at Racquel and smiles. Pulls a six foot length of 
rope from under his pillow. Lets it uncoil to the floor.
