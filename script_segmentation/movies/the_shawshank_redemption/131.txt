 HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE  DAY 1963 162
A ROADGANG is grading a culvert with picks. There's dust and 
the smell of sweat in the air. GUARDS patrol with sniper rifles,
A pushy WOMAN REPORTER in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, 
trailed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. 
WOMAN REPORTER 
You there! You men! We are gonna 
take your picture now! 
HEYWOOD 
Give us a break, lady. 
WOMAN REPORTER 
Don't you know who I am? I am from 
LIFE magazine! I was told I had get 
some cooperation out here! You 
want me to report you to your 
warden? Is that what you want? 
HEYWOOD 
sighs 
No, ma'am. 
WOMAN REPORTER 
That's more like it! Now I want you 
all in a row with big bright smiles 
on your faces! Grab hold of your 
tools and show 'em to me! 
She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. Heywood 
glances around at the other men. 
HEYWOOD 
You heard the lady. 
Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. The others do 
likewise. The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of 
a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. Her
legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade. 
HEYWOOD 
C amon! We are showin' our tools and 
grinnin' like fools! Take the damn 
picture!
