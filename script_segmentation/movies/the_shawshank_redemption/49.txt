 LICENSE PLATE FACTORY  DAY 1949 57
A tarcooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of
tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA
FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to  
58  THE ROOF 58
 where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping
big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron 
Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards 
HADLEY 
...so this shithead lawyer calls 
long distance from Texas, and he 
says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He 
says, sorry to inform you, but your 
brother just died. 
YOUNGBLOOD 
Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. 
HADLEY 
I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off 
years ago, family ain't heard of him 
since. Figured him for dead anyway. 
So this lawyer prick says, your 
brother died a rich man. Oil wells 
and shit, close to a million bucks. 
Jesus, it's frigging incredible how 
lucky some assholes can get. 
TROUT 
A million bucks? JeezLouise! You 
get any of that? 
HADLEY 
Thirty five thousand. That's what 
he left me. 
TROUT 
Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! 
Like winnin' a lottery... 
off Hadley's shitty look 
...ain't it? 
HADLEY 
Dumbshit. What do you figger the 
government's gonna do to me? Take a 
big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 
TROUT 
Oh. Hadn't thought of that. 
HADLEY 
Maybe leave me enough to buy a new 
car with. Then what happens? You 
pay tax on the car. Repairs and 
maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' 
you to take 'em for a ride... 
MERT 
And drive it, if they are old enough. 
HADLEY 
That's right, wanting to drive it, 
wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! 
Then at the end of the year, if you 
figured the tax wrong, they make 
you pay out of your own pocket. 
Uncle Sam puts his hand in your 
shirt and squeezes your tit till 
it's purple. Always get the short 
end. That's a fact. 
spits over the side 
Some brother. Shit. 
The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. 
HEYWOOD 
Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' 
luck. Imagine inheriting thirty 
five thousand dollars. 
RED 
Crying shame. Some folks got it 
awful bad. 
Red glances over  and is shocked to see Andy standing up,
listening to the guards talk. 
RED 
Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on 
your pail! 
Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley.
RED 
Andy! Come back! Shit! 
SNOOZE 
What's he doing? 
FLOYD 
Gettin' himself killed. 
RED 
God damn it... 
HEYWOOD 
Just keep spreadin' tar... 
The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes
to his holster. The tower guards CLICKCLACK their rifle 
bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there. 
ANDY 
Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 
HADLEY 
That's funny. You are gonna look 
funnier suckin' my dick with no 
fuckin' teeth. 
ANDY 
What I mean is, do you think she had 
go behind your back? Try to 
hamstring you? 
HADLEY 
That's it! Step aside, Mert. This 
fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 
Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward
the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.
HEYWOOD 
Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's 
gonna throw him off the roof... 
SNOOZE 
Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... 
ANDY 
Because if you do trust her, there's 
no reason in the world you can't 
keep every cent of that money. 
Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In 
fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 
scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop
to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.
HADLEY 
You better start making sense. 
ANDY 
If you want to keep that money, all 
of it, just give it to your wife. 
See, the IRS allows you a onetime 
only gift to your spouse. It's good 
up to sixty thousand dollars. 
HADLEY 
Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? 
ANDY 
Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 
The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.
HADLEY 
You are the smart banker what shot 
his wife. Why should I believe a 
smart banker like you? So's I can 
wind up in here with you? 
ANDY 
It's perfectly legal. Go ask the 
IRS, they will say the same thing. 
Actually, I feel silly telling you 
all this. I am sure you would have 
investigated the matter yourself. 
HADLEY 
Fuckin'A. I don't need no smart 
wifekillin' banker to show me where 
the bear shit in the buckwheat. 
ANDY 
Of course not. But you will need 
somebody to set up the taxfree 
gift, and that will cost you. A 
lawyer, for example... 
HADLEY 
Ambulancechaaing, highwayrobbing 
cocksuckers! 
ANDY 
...or come to think of it, I 
suppose I could set it up for you. 
That would save you some money. 
I will write down the forms you need, 
you can pick them up, and I will 
prepare them for your signature... 
nearly free of charge. 
off Hadley's look 
I had only ask three beers apiece for 
my coworkers, if that seems fair. 
TROUT 
guffawing 
Coworkers! Get him! That's rich, 
ain't it? Coworkers... 
Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on 
ANDY 
I think a nan working outdoors 
feels more like a man if he can 
have a bottle of suds. That's only 
my opinion. 
The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They
look like they have been poleaxed. Hadley shoots them a look.
HADLEY 
What are you jimmies starin' at? 
Back to work, goddamn it!
