INT  RED'S CELL  NIGHT  273
 PRISON CELL  NIGHT 1966 270
Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start. 
RED V.O. 
But there are times I curse him for 
the dreams he left behind... 
He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita 
Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just 
keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant 
round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the 
tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink 
of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the 
cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. 
A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The 
hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner  papers, 
book, toiletries, bedding  if it ain't nailed down, it gets 
sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the 
suction drags him closer and closer... 
271  RED'S POV 271
...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an 
endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing 
with his drawnout SCREAM, closer and closer to the light... 
...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a 
beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. 
Mindblowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now 
are the gentle sound of waves. 
RED V.O. 
...dreams where I am lost in a warm 
place with no memory. 
A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, 
coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal  Red. 
RED V.O. 
An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. 
Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. 
Sunshine so bright it strikes me 
blind. It is a place that is blue 
beyond reason. Bluer than can 
possibly exist. Bluer than my mind 
can possibly grasp. 
272  AERIAL SHOT 272
Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is 
a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand. 
RED V.O. 
I am terrified. There is no way home.
