INT  RED'S CELL  NIGHT  214
 RED'S CELL  NIGHT 1966 214
Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold 
himself still. He feels like he might scream or shake to 
pieces. The seconds tick by, each an eternity. 
RED V.O. 
I have had some long nights in 
stir. Alone in the dark with 
nothing but your thoughts, time can 
draw out like a blade... 
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred 
shadows jittering across the cell. A storm breaking. 
RED V.O. 
That was the longest night of my 
life...
