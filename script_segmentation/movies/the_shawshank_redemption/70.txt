INT  SHAWSHANK PRISON LIBRARY  DAY  90
 SHAWSHANK PRISON LIBRARY  DAY 1949 90
Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all. Rough
plank shelves are lined with books. Brooks' private domain.
BROOKS 
Here she is, the Shawshank Prison 
Library. Along this side, we got 
the National Geographics. That 
side, the Reader's Digest Condensed 
books. Bottom shelf there, some 
Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley 
Gardners. Every night I pile the 
cart and make my rounds. I write 
down the names on this clipboard 
here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, 
Japanesey. Any questions? 
Andy pauses. Something about this doesn't make any sense.
ANDY 
Brooks? How long have you been 
librarian? 
BROOKS 
Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years. 
ANDY 
In all that time, have you ever had 
an assistant? 
BROOKS 
Never needed one. Not much to it, 
is there? 
ANDY 
So why now? Why me? 
BROOKS 
I dunno. Be nice to have some 
comp'ny down here for a change. 
HADLEY O.S. 
Dufresne! 
91  ANDY STEPS BACK INTO THE OUTER ROOMS AND FINDS HADLEY WITH 91
another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS. 
HADLEY 
That's him. That's the one. 
Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands 
his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally 
DEKINS 
I am Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 
'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 
trust fund for my kids' educations. 
Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles.
ANDY 
I see. Well. Why don't we have a 
seat and talk it over? 
BROOKS 
Pull down one'a them desks there. 
Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the
floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a 
tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy. 
ANDY 
What did you have in mind? A weekly 
draw on your pay? 
DEKINS 
Yuh. I figured just stick it in the 
bank, but Captain Hadley said check 
with you first. 
ANDY 
He was right. You don't want your 
money in a bank. 
DEKINS 
I don't? 
ANDY 
What's that gonna earn you? Two and 
a half, three percent a year? We 
can do a lot better than that. 
wets his pen 
So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do 
you want to send your kids? 
Harvard? Yale?
