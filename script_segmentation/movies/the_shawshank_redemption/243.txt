EXT  COUNTRY ROAD  MORNING 289
 RED'S ROOM  NIGHT 288
Red lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. 
RED V.O. 
Terrible thing, to live in fear. 
Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all 
too well. All I want is to be back 
where things make sense. Where I 
won't have to be afraid all the time. 
He glances up at the ceiling beam. Brooks Hatlen was here. 
RED V.O. 
Only one thing stops me. A promise 
I made to Andy.
