EXT  PRISON YARD  DAY  265
 NORTON'S OFFICE  DAY 1966 264
...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every
key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the
final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door 
bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in
all directions as Norton raises the gun  
 and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall
goes red. His swivel chair does a slow halfturn and creaks to
a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. 
RED V.O. 
I like to think the last thing that 
went through his head...other than 
that bullet...was to wonder how the 
hell Andy Dufresne ever got the 
best of him. 
PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler
trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson
for today HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.
