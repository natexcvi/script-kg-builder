 PRISON CORRIDOR  DAY 1965 173
DOLLYING Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail, 
cigarette behind his ear. We definitely need The Coasters or 
Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis. 
RED V.O. 
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 
1965 on a two year stretch for B&E. 
Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets 
out the back door of a JC Penney.
