EXT  EXERCISE YARD  DAY  36
 EXERCISE YARD  DAY 1947 36
Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, 
lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the
side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 
Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. 
ANDY 
offers his hand 
Hello. I am Andy Dufresne. 
Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.
RED 
The wifekillin' banker. 
ANDY 
How do you know that? 
RED 
I keep my ear to the ground. Why had 
you do it? 
ANDY 
I didn't, since you ask. 
RED 
Hell, you will fit right in, then. 
off Andy's look 
Everyone's innocent in here, don't 
you know that? Heywood! What are 
you in for, boy? 
HEYWOOD 
Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 
Red gives Andy a look. See? 
ANDY 
What else have you heard? 
RED 
People say you are a cold fish. They 
say you think your shit smells 
sweeter than ordinary. That true? 
ANDY 
What do you think? 
RED 
Ain't made up my mind yet. 
Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the
ball hard  right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of
the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends
the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood
drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 
ANDY 
I understand you are a man who knows 
how to get things. 
RED 
I am known to locate certain things 
from time to time. They seem to 
fall into my hands. Maybe it's 
'cause I am Irish. 
ANDY 
I wonder if you could get me a 
rockhammer? 
RED 
What is it and why? 
ANDY 
You make your customers' motives a 
part of your business? 
RED 
If you wanted a toothbrush, I 
wouldn't ask questions. I had just 
quote a price. A toothbrush, see, 
is a nonlethal sort of object. 
ANDY 
Fair enough. A rockhammer is about 
eight or nine inches long. Looks 
like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
small sharp pick on one end, and a 
blunt hammerhead on the other. It's 
for rocks. 
RED 
Rocks. 
Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of
dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and
rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.
RED 
Quartz? 
ANDY 
Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. 
Silted granite. There's some graded 
limestone, from when they cut this 
place out of the hill. 
RED 
So? 
ANDY 
I am a rockhound. At least I was, in 
my old life. I had like to be again, 
on a limited scale. 
RED 
Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 
in somebody's skull? 
ANDY 
I have no enemies here. 
RED 
No? Just wait. 
Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. 
RED 
Word gets around. The Sisters have 
taken a real shine to you, yes they 
have. Especially Bogs. 
ANDY 
Tell me something. Would it help if 
I explained to them I am not 
homosexual? 
RED 
Neither are they. You have to be 
human first. They don't qualify. 
off Andy's look 
Bull queers take by force, that's 
all they want or understand. I had 
grow eyes in the back of my head if 
I were you. 
ANDY 
Thanks for the advice. 
RED 
That comes free. But you understand 
my concern. 
ANDY 
If there's trouble, I doubt a rock 
hammer will do me any good. 
RED 
Then I guess you wanna escape. 
Tunnel under the wall maybe? 
Andy laughs politely 
I miss the joke. What's so funny? 
ANDY 
You will know when you see the rock 
hammer. 
RED 
What's this item usually go for? 
ANDY 
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.
RED 
My standard markup's twenty 
percent, but we are talkin' about a 
special object. Risk goes up, price 
goes up. Call it ten bucks even. 
ANDY 
Ten it is. 
RED 
I will see what I can do. 
rises, slapping dust 
But it's a waste of money. 
ANDY 
Oh? 
RED 
Folks who run this place love 
surprise inspections. They turn a 
blind eye to some things, but not 
a gadget like that. They will find 
it, and you will lose it. Mention my 
name, we will never do business 
again. Not for a pair of shoelaces 
or a stick of gum. 
ANDY 
I understand. Thank you, Mr...? 
RED 
Red. The name's Red. 
ANDY 
Red. I am Andy. Pleasure doing 
business with you. 
They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. 
RED V.O. 
I could see why some of the boys 
took him for snobby. He had a quiet 
way about him, a walk and a talk 
that just wasn't normal around 
here. He strolled. like a man in a 
park without a care or worry. Like 
he had on an invisible coat that 
would shield him from this place. 
resumes playing catch 
Yes, I think it would be fair to 
say I liked Andy from the start.
