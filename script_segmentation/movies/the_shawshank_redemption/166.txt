EXT  PRISON  NIGHT  198
 PRISON  NIGHT 1966 198
A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, 
unlocks it. Tommy looks around. 
TOMMY 
Out here? 
MERT 
That's what the man said. 
Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and 
heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loadingdock
access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The 
place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence. 
TOMMY 
Warden? 
Norton steps into the light. 
NORTON 
Tommy, we have got a situation here. 
I think you can appreciate that. 
TOMMY 
Yes sir, I sure can. 
NORTON 
I tell you, son, this really came 
along and knocked my wind out. It's 
got me up nights, that's the truth. 
Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy
takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter.
NORTON 
The right decision. Sometimes it's 
hard to figure out what that is. 
You understand? 
Tommy nods 
Think hard, Tommy. If I am gonna 
move on this, there can't be the 
least little shred of doubt. I have 
to know if you what you told 
Dufresne was the truth. 
TOMMY 
Yes sir. Absolutely. 
NORTON 
Would you be willing to swear before 
a judge and jury...having placed 
your hand on the Good Book and taken 
an oath before Almighty God Himself? 
TOMMY 
Just gimme that chance. 
NORTON 
That's what I thought. 
Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his 
shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as  
199  HIGH 
 a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image 
into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs.

gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. He smacks the ground in 
a twitching, thrashing heap. Eyes wide and staring. Dead. 
Surprise still stamped on his face. Silence now. Norton 
turns, strolls into darkness.
