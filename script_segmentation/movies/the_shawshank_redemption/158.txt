TOMMY 
'Bout four years ago, I was in 
Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. 
Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. 
beat 
Few months left to go, I get a new 
cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big 
twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of 
roomie you pray you don't get, know 
what I am sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed 
burglary. Said he done hundreds of 
jobs. Hard to believe, highstrung 
as he was. Cut a loud fart, he had go 
three feet in the air. Talked all 
the time, too, that's the other 
thing. Never shut up. Places he had 
been, jobs he pulled, women he 
fucked. Even people he killed. 
People that gave him shit, that's 
how he put it. One night, like a 
joke, I say Yeah? Who had you 
kill? So he says... 
BLATCH 
...I got me this job one time 
bussin' tables at a country club. 
So I could case all the big rich 
pricks that come in. I pick out 
this guy, go in one night and do 
his place. He wakes up and gives 
me shit. So I killed him. Him and 
the tasty bitch he was with. 
starts laughing 
That's the best part! She's fuckin' 
this prick, see, this golf pro, but 
she's married to some other guy! 
Some hotshot banker. He's the one 
they pinned it on! They got him 
downMaine somewhere doin' time for 
the crime! Ain't that choice? 
He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter.
