 MAIN BUILDING  STORAGE ROOMS  DAY 1949 89
A series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing 
cabinets, desks, paint supplies, etc. Andy enters. He hears a
FLUTTER OF WINGS. An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and
struts back and forth, checking him out. Andy smiles. 
ANDY 
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? 
Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room. 
BROOKS 
Andy! Thought I heard you out here! 
ANDY 
I have been reassigned to you. 
BROOKS 
I know, they told me. Ain't that a 
kick in the ass? Come on in, I will 
give you the dime tour.
