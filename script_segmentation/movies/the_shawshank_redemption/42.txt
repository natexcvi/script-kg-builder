 BACK ROOMSSTOCK AREA  DAY 1947 46
 a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and
furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of 
cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a 
cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around  
 and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way.
Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness
on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the
floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.
ANDY 
You get this in your eyes, it 
blinds you. 
BOGS 
Honey, hush. 
Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 
the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes 
riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. 
Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. 
They are on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 
Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from 
behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against 
an old fourpocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams 
a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 
a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete 
have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear 
BOGS 
That's it, fight. Better that way. 
Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 
SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see 
is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 
...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place 
and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past 
concrete walls and steel pipes... 
RED V.O. 
I wish I could tell you that Andy 
fought the good fight, and the 
Sisters let him be. I wish I could 
tell you that, but prison is no 
fairytale world. 
WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for 
a final view of the line. The giant steel mangler is 
slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. 
RED V.O. 
He never said who did it...but we 
all knew. 
PRISON MONTAGE 1947 through 1949 
47  ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47
shaping his rocks after lightsout... 
RED V.O. 
Things went on like that for a 
while. Prison life consists of 
routine, and then more routine. 
48  ANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48 
RED V.O. 
Every so often, Andy would show up 
with fresh bruises. 
49  ANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49
RED V.O. 
The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes 
he was able to fight them off... 
sometimes not. 
50  ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, 
wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. 
RED V.O. 
He always fought, that's what I 
remember. He fought because he knew 
if he didn't fight, it would make 
it that much easier not to fight 
the next time. 
The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They 
beat the hell out of him. 
RED V.O. 
Half the time it landed him in the 
infirmary...
