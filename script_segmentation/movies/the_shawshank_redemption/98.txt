 BROOKS' ROOM  SHORTLY LATER 1954 119
Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, 
puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 
and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door. 
BROOKS V.O. 
I don't like it here. I am tired of 
being afraid all the time. I have 
decided not to stay. 
He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He 
steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 
pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. 
He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing
the beam, he carves a message into the wood Brooks Hatlen
was here. He smiles with a sort of inner peace. 
BROOKS V.O. 
I doubt they will kick up any fuss. 
Not for an old crook like me. 
120  TIGHT ON CHAIR 120
His weight shifts on the wobbly chair  and it goes out 
from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly 
in midair. His hat falls to the floor. 
facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below.
