 PRISON YARD  THE BLEACHERS  DAY 1949 61
Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move. 
RED 
King me. 
ANDY 
Chess. Now there's a game of kings. 
Civilized...strategic... 
RED 
...and totally fuckin' 
inexplicable. Hate that game. 
ANDY 
Maybe you will let me teach you 
someday. I have been thinking of 
getting a board together. 
RED 
You come to the right place. I am 
the man who can get things. 
ANDY 
We might do business on a board. But 
the pieces, I had like to carve those 
myself. One side done in quartz... 
the opposing side in limestone. 
RED 
That had take you years. 
ANDY 
Years I have got. What I don't have 
are the rocks. Pickings here in the 
exercise yard are pretty slim. 
RED 
How's that rockhammer workin' out 
anyway? Scratch your name on your 
wall yet? 
ANDY 
smiles 
Not yet. I suppose I should. 
RED 
Andy? I guess we are gettin' to be 
friends, ain't we? 
ANDY 
I suppose we are. 
RED 
I ask a question? Why had you do it? 
ANDY 
I am innocent, remember? Just like 
everybody else here. 
Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing. 
ANDY 
What are you in for, Red? 
RED 
Murder. Same as you. 
ANDY 
Innocent? 
RED 
The only guilty man in Shawshank.
