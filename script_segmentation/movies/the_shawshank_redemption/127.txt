 PRISON LIBRARY  DAY 1960 158
Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books. 
RED V.O. 
You had be amazed how far Andy could 
stretch it. He made deals with book 
clubs, charity groups...he bought 
remaindered books by the pound... 
HEYWOOD 
Treasure Island. Robert Louis... 
ANDY 
jotting 
...Stevenson. Next? 
RED 
I got here an auto repair manual, 
and a book on soap carving. 
ANDY 
Trade skills and hobbies, those go 
under educational. Stack right 
behind you. 
HEYWOOD 
The Count of Monte Crisco... 
FLOYD 
Cristo, you dumbshit. 
HEYWOOD 
...by Alexandree Dumbass. 
ANDY 
Dumas. You boys will like that one. 
It's about a prison break. 
Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it 
first. Red shoots Andy a look. 
RED 
Maybe that should go under 
educational too.
