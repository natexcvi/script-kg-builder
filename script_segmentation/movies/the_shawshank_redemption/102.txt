EXT  FIELDS  DAY  124
 FIELDS  DAY 1954 124
Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in 
the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye.
We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and 
shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley's 
chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS. 
GUARD 
Water break! Five minutes! 
The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is
dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy.
Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the 
confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a 
nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The 
guards haven't noticed. 
Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, 
quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and 
pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and 
varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval. 
ANDY 
That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. 
HEYWOOD 
Shovel man in. Watch the dirt.

Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole. 
125  BY THE TRUCK 125
Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope. 
YOUNGBLOOD 
What the fuck. 
HADLEY 
follows his gaze 
HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR 
ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE! 
works his rifle bolt 
YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU 
GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT 
SOMEBODY! 
Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of
them heading toward the slope. The guards look around. 
HADLEY 
What am I, talkin' to myself? 
126  ON THE SLOPE 126
Andy pulls a towelwrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds
it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's 
letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of 
silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. 
RED 
Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was 
just a crow. Neither was much to 
look at. Both got institutionalized. 
See what you can do for 'em. Amen. 
Muttered amens all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the 
small grave and tamp it down.
