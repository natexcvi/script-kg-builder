EXT  EXERCISE YARD  SHAWSHANK PRISON  DUSK  10
 EXERCISE YARD  SHAWSHANK PRISON  DUSK 1947 10
High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 
in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
other, making deals. Exercise period. 
RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches lowkey through the 
activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
minor business. He's an important man here. 
RED V.O. 
There's a con like me in every prison 
in America, I guess. I am the guy who 
can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 
bag of reefer if you are partial, a 
bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
kid's high school graduation. Damn 
near anything, within reason. 
He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleightofhand.
RED V.O. 
Yes sir, I am a regular Sears & 
Roebuck. 
TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing 
everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate 
swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. 
RED V.O. 
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 
1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita 
Hayworth into the prison for him, I 
told him no problem. And it wasn't. 
CON 
Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! 
Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. 
Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his 
group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.
