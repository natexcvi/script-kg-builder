TILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy 
sort books on the shelves. 
RED 
Got his fingers in a lot of pies, 
from what I hear. 
ANDY 
What you hear isn't half of it. 
He's got scams you haven't dreamed 
of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. 
There's a river of dirty money 
flowing through this place. 
RED 
Money like that can be a problem. 
Sooner or later you gotta explain 
where it came from. 
ANDY 
That's where I come in. I channel 
it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, 
securities, tax free municipals... 
I send that money out into the big 
world. And when it comes back... 
RED 
It's clean as a virgin's whistle? 
ANDY 
Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, 
I will have made him a millionaire. 
RED 
Jesus. They ever catch on, he's 
gonna wind up wearing a number 
himself. 
ANDY 
smiles 
I thought you had more faith in me 
than that. 
RED 
I am sure you are good, but all that 
paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets 
too curious  FBI, IRS, whatever  
that trail's gonna lead to somebody. 
ANDY 
Sure it will. But not to me, and 
certainly not to the warden. 
RED 
Who then? 
ANDY 
Peter Stevens. 
RED 
Who? 
ANDY 
The silent, silent partner. He's 
the guilty one, your Honor. The man 
with the bank accounts. That's 
where the filtering process starts. 
They trace it back, all they are 
gonna find is him. 
RED 
Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?
ANDY 
A phantom. An apparition. Second 
cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. 
off Red's look 
I conjured him out of thin air. He 
doesn't exist...except on paper. 
RED 
You can't just make a person up. 
ANDY 
Sure you can, if you know how the 
system works, and where the cracks 
are. It's amazing what you can 
accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has 
a birth certificate, social 
security card, driver's license. 
They ever track those accounts, 
they will wind up chasing a figment 
of my imagination. 
RED 
Jesus. Did I say you were good? 
You are Rembrandt. 
ANDY 
It's funny. On the outside, I was 
an honest man. Straight as an 
arrow. I had to come to prison to 
be a crook.
