FLASHBULBS POP as Norton addresses MEMBERS OF THE PRESS 
RED V.O. 
That was also the year Warden Norton 
instituted his famous InsideOut 
program. You may remember reading 
about it. It made all the papers 
and got his picture in LIFE magazine. 
NORTON 
...a genuine, progressive advance 
in corrections and rehabilitation. 
Our inmates, properly supervised, 
will be put to work outside these 
walls performing all manner of 
public service. Cutting pulpwood, 
repairing bridges and causeways, 
digging storm drains... 
NORTON 
These men can learn the value of an 
honest day's labor while providing 
a valuable service to the community 
 and at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer! 
HEYWOOD 
Sounds like roadgangin', you ask me. 
RED 
Nobody asked you.
