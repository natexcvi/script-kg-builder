 MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY  DAY 1949 93
DOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall 
NORTON 
Not a dime. My budget's stretched 
thin as it is. 
ANDY 
I see. Perhaps I could write to the 
State Senate and request funds 
directly from them. 
NORTON 
Far as them Republican boys in 
Augusta are concerned, there's only 
three ways to spend the taxpayer's 
hardearned when it come to prisons. 
More walls. More bars. More guards. 
ANDY 
Still, I had like to try, with your 
permission. I will send a letter a 
week. They can't ignore me forever. 
NORTON 
They sure can, but you write your 
letters if it makes you happy. I will 
even mail 'em for you, how's that?
