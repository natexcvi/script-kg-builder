EXT  FIELDS  LATE DAY  269
 MESS HALL  DAY 1966 268
Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy. 
RED V.O. 
Those of us who knew him best talk 
about him often. I swear, the stuff 
he pulled. It always makes us laugh. 
A wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy.
RED V.O. 
Sometimes it makes me sad, though, 
Andy being gone. I have to remind 
myself that some birds aren't meant 
to be caged, that's all. Their 
feathers are just too bright...
