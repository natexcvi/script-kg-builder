 NORTON'S OFFICE  NIGHT 1965 165
RED V.O. 
And behind every shady deal, behind 
every dollar earned... 
TILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he 
totals up figures on an adding machine. 
RED V.O. 
...there was Andy, keeping the books. 
Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near 
the desk, keeping a watchful eye. 
ANDY 
Two deposits, Casco Bank and New 
England First. Night drop, like 
always. 
Norton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe 
and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks 
the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He 
cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner. 
NORTON 
Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two 
suits for dryclean and a bag of 
whatnot. Tell 'em if they over 
starch my shirts again, they are 
gonna hear about it from me. 
adjusts his tie 
How do I look? 
ANDY 
Very nice. 
NORTON 
Big charity todo up Portland 
way. Governor's gonna be there. 
indicates pie 
Want the rest of that? Woman can't 
bake worth shit.
