 WOODED FIELDS  DAY 1965 164
A ROADGANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud. 
RED V.O. 
'Course, Norton failed to mention 
to the press that bare minimum of 
expense is a fairly loose term. 
There are a hundred different ways 
to skim off the top. Men, 
materials, you name it. And, oh my 
Lord, how the money rolled in... 
Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels. 
NED 
This keeps up, you are gonna put me 
out of business! With this pool of 
slave labor you got, you can 
underbid any contractor in town. 
NORTON 
Ned, we are providing a valuable 
community service. 
NED 
That's fine for the papers, but I 
got a family to feed. The State 
don't pay my salary. Sam, we go 
back a long way. I need this new 
highway contract. I don't get it, I 
go under. That's a fact. 
hands him a box 
Now you just have some'a this fine 
pie my missus baked specially for 
you, and you think about that. 
Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He
runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.
IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the
air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming
in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over
to help him. Norton barely takes notice. 
NORTON 
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over 
this contract. Seems to me I have 
already got my boys committed 
elsewhere. You be sure and thank 
Maisie for this fine pie.
