 RED'S CELL  NIGHT 1957 155
...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the 
cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days... 
He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian 
artifact. He considers trying it out  even holds it briefly 
to his lips, almost embarrassed  but puts it back in its box
untested. And there the harmonica will stay...

RED V.O. 
Andy was as good as his word. He 
kept writing to the State Senate. 
Two letters a week instead of one. 
...and the NESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before 
our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers, 
faces obscured outlawstyle with kerchiefs against the dust. 
Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. 
Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red
and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the
wall, exploring what used to be a sealedoff storage room. 
RED V.O. 
In 1959, the folks up Augusta way 
finally clued in to the fact they

200 dollar check. Appropriations 
Committee voted an annual payment of 
500 dollars, just to shut him up.
