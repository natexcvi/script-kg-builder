 SHAWSHANK PRISON  VARIOUS LOCATIONS  DAY 1955 136
Cons all over the prison stop whatever they are doing, freezing 
in midstep to listen, gazing up at the speakers. 
137  THE STAMPING MACHINES IN THE PLATE SHOP ARE SHUT DOWN... 137 
138  THE LAUNDRY LINE GOES SILENT, GRINDING TO A HALT... 138
139  THE WOOD SHOP MACHINES ARE TURNED OFF, BUZZING TO A STOP... 139
140  THE MOTOR POOL...THE KITCHEN...THE LOADING DOCK...THE EXERCISE 140
thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru
143  TO A STUTTERING HALT. NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS. EVERYBODY 143
just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized.
