 PRISON AUDITORIUM  NIGHT 1949 64
...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back 
to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, 
watching the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering 
glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him. 
RED 
Here's the good part. Bugs come out 
of the walls to get his ass. 
ANDY 
I know. I have seen it three times 
this month already. 
Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with 
him, highpitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 
ANDY 
Can we talk business? 
RED 
Sure. What do you want? 
ANDY 
Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 
RED 
No problem. Take a few weeks. 
ANDY 
Weeks? 
RED 
Don't have her stuffed down my 
pants this very moment, sorry to 
say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
about? She's just a woman. 
Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
turns back to the movie.
