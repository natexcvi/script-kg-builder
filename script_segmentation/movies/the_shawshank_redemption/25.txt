INT  CELLBLOCK  NIGHT  29
 CELLBLOCK  NIGHT 1947 29
The place goes nuts. FatAss throws himself screaming against
the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING 
VOICES 
Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 
fish...fresh fish... 
FATASS 
I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' 
VOICE O.S. 
I had your mother! She wasn't that 
great! 
The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.
HADLEY 
What the Christ is this happy shit? 
VOICE O.S. 
He took the Lord's name in vain! 
I am tellin' the warden! 
HADLEY 
to the unseen wit 
You will be tellin' him with my baton 
up your ass! 
Hadley arrives at FatAss' cell, bellowing through the bars
HADLEY 
What's your malfunction you fat 
fuckin' barrel of monkeyspunk? 
FATASS 
PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T 
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! 
HADLEY 
I ain't gonna count to three! Not 
even to one! Now shut the fuck up 
'fore I sing you a lullabye! 
FatAss keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freakout. Hadley 
draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. 
A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls FatAss out and starts 
beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. FatAss 
falls, tries to crawl. 
The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull
THWACKTHWACKTHWACK of the baton. Fatass passes out. Hadley
gets in a few more licks and finally stops. 
HADLEY 
Get this tub of shit down to the 
infirmary. 
peers around 
If I hear so much as a mouse fart 
in here the rest of the night, by 
God and Sonny Jesus, you will all 
visit the infirmary. Every last 
motherfucker here. 
The guards wrestle FatAss onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence.
