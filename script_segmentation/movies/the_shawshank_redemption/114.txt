 EXERCISE YARD  DAY 1955 145
CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted. 
RED V.O. 
I have no idea to this day what 
them two Italian ladies were 
singin' about. Truth is, I don't 
want to know. Some things are best 
left unsaid. I like to think they 
were singin' about something so 
beautiful it can't be expressed in 
words, and makes your heart ache 
because of it. 
CAMERA brings us to Red. 
RED V.O. 
I tell you, those voices soared. 
Higher and farther than anybody in 
a gray place dares to dream. It was 
like some beautiful bird flapped 
into our drab little cage and made 
these walls dissolve away...and for 
the briefest of moments  every 
last man at Shawshank felt free.
