INT  RED'S ROOM  DAY  293
 HAYFIELD  DAY 292
Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel 
scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies
the base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of
rocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. 
Something catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering 
closer. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes 
off. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock 
out, anticipation growing. It won't come it's too smooth. He 
pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his 
feet, leaving a ragged hole. 
Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the 
object buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped 
in plastic. Written on it is a single word Red. 
Red pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for 
a while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside 
is a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read 
ANDY V.O. 
Dear Red. If you are reading this, 
you have gotten out. And if you have 
come this far, maybe you are willing 
to come a little further. You 
remember the name of the town, 
don't you? I could use a good man 
to help me get my project on 
wheels. I will keep an eye out for 
you and the chessboard ready. 
beat 
Remember, Red. Hope is a good 
thing, maybe the best of things, 
and no good thing ever dies. I will 
be hoping that this letter finds 
you, and finds you well. Your 
friend. Andy. 
By now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He 
opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty 
dollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars.
