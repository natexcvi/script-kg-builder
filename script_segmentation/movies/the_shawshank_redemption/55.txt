 AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR  NIGHT 1949 65
Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
Pete. Andy turns back  and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 
door open and drag him into  
66  THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66
 where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con
blinking at them through thick bifocals. 
BOGS 
Take a walk. 
PROJECTIONIST 
I have to change reels. 
BOGS 
I said fuck off. 
Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 
ANDY 
I know. I have seen it three times 
this month already. 
Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS witt 
him, highpitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 
ANDY 
Can we talk business? 
RED 
Sure. What do you want? 
ANDY 
Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 
RED 
No problem. Take a few weeks. 
ANDY 
Weeks? 
RED 
Don't have her stuffed down my 
pants this very moment, sorry to 
say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
about? She's just a woman. 
Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
turns back to the movie.
