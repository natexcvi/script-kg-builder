 ANDY'S CELL  NIGHT 1949 82
Andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk. 
GUARD O.S. 
Lights out! 
The lights go off. Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large 
rolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap 
of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the
famous Rita Hayworth pinup  one hand behind her head, eyes
half closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of 
paper. It reads No charge. Welcome back. Alone in the dark,
Andy smiles.
