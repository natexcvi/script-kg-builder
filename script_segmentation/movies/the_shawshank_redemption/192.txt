 FIELD  DAY 1966 229
Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel
as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE
fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. 
RED V.O. 
All they found of him was a muddy 
set of prison clothes, a bar of 
soap, and an old rockhammer damn 
near worn down to the nub. 
TROOPER g2 pulls the rockhammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN 
to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces 
230  A  AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230
of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the
worn rockhammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. 
RED V.O. 
I remember thinking it would take a 
man six hundred years to tunnel 
through the wall with it. Andy did 
it in less than twenty.
