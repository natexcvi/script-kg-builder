Rest break. Tommy and Red sipping Cokes. 
TOMMY 
I feel bad. I let him down. 
RED 
That's crap, son. He's proud of 
you. Proud as a hen. 
off Tommy's look 
We been friends a long time. I know 
him as good as anybody. 
TOMMY 
Smart fella, ain't he? 
RED 
Smart as they come. Used to be a 
banker on the outside. 
TOMMY 
What's he in for anyway? 
RED 
Murder. 
TOMMY 
The hell you say. 
RED 
You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. 
Caught his wife in bed with some 
golf pro. Greased 'em both. C amon, 
boy, back to work... 
SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand 
and shattered on the floor. The kid's gone white as a sheet. 
TOMMY 
bare whisper 
Oh my God...
