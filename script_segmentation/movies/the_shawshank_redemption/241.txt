 EMPLOYEE RESTROOM  DAY 286

shutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. 
He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. 
He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He 
glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. 
He enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down 
and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and 
touch the walls now. They are close. Safe. Almost small enough. 
He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. 
He will just sit here for a while. Until he calms down.
