INT  COURTROOM  DAY  6
 COURTROOM  DAY 1946 6
The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation
D.A. 
Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard 
all the evidence, you know all the 
facts. We have the accused at the 
scene of the crime. We have foot 
prints. Tire tracks. Bullets 
scattered on the ground which bear 
his fingerprints. A broken bourbon 
bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
Most of all, we have a beautiful 
young woman and her lover lying 
dead in each other's arms. They had 
sinned. But was their crime so 
great as to merit a death sentence? 
He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. 
D.A. 
I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to 
that would be yes. I further 
suspect he carried out that 
sentence on the night of September 
21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, 
by pumping four bullets into his 
wife and another four into Glenn 
Quentin. And while you think about 
that, think about this... 
He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 
D.A. 
A revolver holds six bullets, not 
eight. I submit to you this was not 
a hotblooded crime of passion! 
That could at least be understood, 
if not condoned. No, this was 
revenge of a much more brutal and 
coldblooded nature. Consider! Four 
bullets per victim! Not six shots 
fired, but eight! That means he 
fired the gun empty...and then 
stopped to reload so he could shoot 
each of them again! An extra bullet 
per lover...right in the head. 
a few JURORS shiver 
I am done talking. You people are 
all decent, Godfearing Christian 
folk. You know what to do.
