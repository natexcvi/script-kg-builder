 WOOD SHOP  DAY 1965 174
A SHRIEKING BUZZSAW slices tenfoot lengths of wood. Red runs 
the machine while some other OLDTIMERS feed the wood. 
RED V.O. 
Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky 
as hell... 
Tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it, 
It's a ballbusting job, but the kid's a blur. 
TOMMY 
slapping his gloves 
C amon there, old boys! Movin' like 
molasses! Makin' me look bad! 
The old guys just grin and shake their heads. 
RED V.O. 
We liked him immediately.
