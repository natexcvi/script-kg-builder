 CELLBLOCK FIVE  NIGHT 1947 21
LOW 
GUARD 
That's lights out! Good night, ladies. 
The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps
echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the 
tiers toward Red's cell. 
RED V.O. 
I remember my first night. Seems a 
long time ago now. 
Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. 
Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.
VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting 
VARIOUS VOICES O.S. 
Fishee fishee fisheeee...You are 
gonna like it here, new fish. A 
whooole lot...Make you wish your 
daddies never dicked your 
mommies...You takin' this down, new 
fish? Gonna be a quiz later. 
somebody LAUGHS 
Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws will 
hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... 
RED V.O. 
The boys always go fishin' with 
firsttimers...and they don't quit 
till they reel someone in. 
The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark...
