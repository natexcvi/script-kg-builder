 CELLBLOCK FIVE  2ND TIER  NIGHT 1947 43
Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The 
rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the 
rockhammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the
cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. 
RED 
Dufresne. 
Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to 
Andy's cell, mutters through the bars 
BROOKS 
Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 
Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object 
disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of 
folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart
around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough
for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, 
scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket.
