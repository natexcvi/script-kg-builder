INT  PRISON BUS  DUSK  11
 PRISON BUS  DUSK 1947 11
Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. 
RED V.O. 
Andy came to Shawshank Prison in 
early 1947 for murdering his wife 
and the fella she was bangin'. 
The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes 
around, swallowed by prison walls. 
RED V.O. 
On the outside, he had been vice 
president of a large Portland bank. 
Good work for a man as young as he 
was, when you consider how 
conservative banks were back then. 
TOWER GUARD 
All clear! 
GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. 
The new fish disembark, chained together singlefile, blinking 
sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in 
front of him, almost drags him down. 
BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 
Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS 
and SHOUTS from the spectators. 
HADLEY 
On your feet before I fuck you up 
so bad you never walk again.

RED 
There they are, boys. The Human 
Charm Bracelet. 
HEYWOOD 
Never seen such a sorrylookin' 
heap of maggot shit in my life. 
JIGGER 
Comin' from you, Heywood, you being 
so pretty and all... 
FLOYD 
Takin' bets today, Red? 
RED 
pulls notepad and pencil 
Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? 
Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. 
FLOYD 
Smokes. Put me down for two. 
RED 
High roller. Who's your horse? 
FLOYD 
That gangly sack of shit, third 
from the front. He will be the first. 
HEYWOOD 
Bullshit. I will take that action. 
ERNIE 
Me too. 
Other hands go up. Red jots the names. 
HEYWOOD 
You are out some smokes, son. Take 
my word. 
FLOYD 
You are so smart, you call it. 
HEYWOOD 
I say that chubby fatass...let's 
see...fifth from the front. Put me 
down for a quarter deck. 
RED 
That's five cigarettes on FatAss. 
Any takers? 
More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, 
forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The oldtimers are 
shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
terrified. Especially Andy. 
RED V.O. 
I must admit I didn't think much of 
Andy first time I laid eyes on him. 
He might'a been important on the 
outside, but in here he was just a 
little turd in prison grays. Looked 
like a stiff breeze could blow him 
over. That was my first impression 
of the man. 
SKEET 
What say, Red? 
RED 
Little fella on the end. Definitely. 
I stake half a pack. Any takers? 
SNOOZE 
Rich bet. 
RED 
C amon, boys, who's gonna prove me 
wrong? 
hands go up 
Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave 
souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, 
gentlemen, this window's closed. 
Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers
VOICE amplified 
Return to your cellblocks for 
evening count.
