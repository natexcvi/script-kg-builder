INT  PRISON CELL  NIGHT  270
 FIELDS  LATE DAY 1966 269
Convicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback. 
RED V.O. 
...and when they fly away, the part 
of you that knows it was a sin to 
lock them up does rejoice...but still, 
the place you live is that much more 
drab and empty that they are gone. 
A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm 
clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins. 
RED V.O. 
I guess I just miss my friend.
