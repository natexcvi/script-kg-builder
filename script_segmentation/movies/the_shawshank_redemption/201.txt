INT  NORTON'S OFFICE  MINUTES LATER  244
 HALLWAY  NIGHT 1966 243
Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on 
the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling 
Norton's dress shoes from their box. 
RED V.O. 
Andy did like he was told. Buffed 
those shoes to a high mirror shine.
