INT  BREWSTER  RED'S DOOR  DAY  294
 RED'S ROOM  DAY 1967 293
Red is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts 
his hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look 
around. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to 
the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. 
RED V.O. 
Get busy living or get busy dying. 
That is goddamn right. 
He steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight.
