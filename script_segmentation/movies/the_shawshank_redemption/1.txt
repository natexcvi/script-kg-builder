INT  CABIN  NIGHT  
 CABIN  NIGHT 1946 
A dark, empty room. 
The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 
giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 
they are all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
flesh, mouths locked together. 
He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 
He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
the sensations running through her. He carries her across the 
room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling 
smoothly outside...
