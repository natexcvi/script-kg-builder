EXT  FIELD  DAY  79
 FIELD  DAY 1949 79
A HUNDRED CONS at work. Hoes rise and fall in long waves. 
GUARDS patrol on horseback. Heywood turns up a rocky chunk, 
quickly shoves it down his pants. He maneuvers to Red and the 
others, pulls out the chunk and shows it to them. 
FLOYD 
That ain't quartz. Nor limestone. 
HEYWOOD 
What are you, fuckin' geologist? 
SNOOZE 
He's right, it ain't. 
HEYWOOD 
What the hell is it then? 
RED 
Horse apple. 
HEYWOOD 
Bullshit. 
RED 
No, horse shit. Petrified. 
Cackling, the men go back to work. Heywood stares at the rock.
He crumbles it in his hands. 
RED V.O. 
Despite a few hitches, the boys 
came through in fine style...
