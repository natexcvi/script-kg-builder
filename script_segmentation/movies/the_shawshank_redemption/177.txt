 RED'S CELL  NIGHT 1966 212
Red hears Andy coming, moves to the bars. He watches Andy come 
up to the second tier and pause before his cell. 
GUARD O.S. 
Open number twelve! 
Andy gazes directly at Red. A beat of eye contact. Red shakes 
his head. Don't do it. Andy smiles, eerily calm...and enters 
his cell. The door closes. KATHUMP! We hold on Red's face.
