 VISITOR'S ROOM  DAY 1965 177
CAMERA TRAVELS the room. Chaotic. CONS are waiting their turn 
or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield. 
RED V.O. 
As it turns out, Tommy had himself 
a young wife and new baby girl... 
Tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. Other side of
the glass is BETH, near tears, fussing with a BABY on her lap.
BETH 
...said we can stay with them, but 
Joey's gettin' out of the service 
next month, and they barely got 
enough room as it is. Plus they got 
Poppa workin' double shifts and the 
baby cries half the night. I just 
don't know where we are gonna go... 
PUSH IN on Tommy's face as he listens. 
RED V.O. 
Maybe it was the thought of them on 
the streets...or his child growing 
up not knowing her daddy...
