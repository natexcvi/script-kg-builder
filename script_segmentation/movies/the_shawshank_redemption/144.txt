 MESS HALL  DAY 1965 175
Tommy regales the old boys with his exploits 
TOMMY 
...so I am backin' out the door, 
right? Had the TV like this... 
mimes his grip 
Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. 
Suddenly, here's this voice 
Freeze kid! Hands in the air! 
Well I just stand there holdin' on 
to that TV, so the voice says You 
hear what I said, boy? And I say, 
Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop
this fuckin' thing, you got me on 
destruction of property too!
The whole table falls about laughing.
