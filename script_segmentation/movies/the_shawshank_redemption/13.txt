The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The
chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor. 
HADLEY 
Eyes front. 
WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray
suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could 
piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.
NORTON 
This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the 
guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. 
You are sinners and scum, that's 
why they sent you to me. Rule 
number one no blaspheming. I will 
not have the Lord's name taken in 
vain in my prison. The other rules 
you will figure out as you go along. 
Any questions? 
CON 
When do we eat? 
Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams
right in his face 
HADLEY 
YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU 
PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT 
WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP 
WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT 
DICK MOTHERFUCKER! 
Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The 
man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. 
Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly 
NORTON 
Any other questions?

Put your faith in the Lord. Your 
ass belongs to me. Welcome to 
Shawshank. 
HADLEY 
Off with them clothes! And I didn't 
say take all day doing it, did I? 
The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked. 
HADLEY 
First man into the shower! 
Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the 
front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed 
against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. 
Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out. 
HADLEY 
Delouse that piece of shit! Next 
man in! 
The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all
over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes,
he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short
stack of items through the slot  prison clothes and a Bible.
All the men are processed quickly  a blast of water, powder,
clothes and a Bible...
