 PRISON YARD  DUSK 1965 
RED 
Does it ever bother you? 
ANDY 
I don't run the scams, Red, I just 
process the profits. That's a fine 
line, maybe. But I have also built 
that library, and used it to help a 
dozen guys get their high school 
diplomas. Why do you think the 
warden lets me do all that? 
RED 
To keep you happy and doing the 
laundry. Money instead of sheets. 
ANDY 
I work cheap. That's the tradeoff. 
TWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate. It 
swings open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside.
