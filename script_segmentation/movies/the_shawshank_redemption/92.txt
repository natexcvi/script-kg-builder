INT  BROOKS' ROOM  DAY  113
 BROOKS' ROOM  DAY 1954 113
Brooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden 
beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of 
Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag 
down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, 
like a man waiting for a bus.

and a job bagging groceries at the 
Foodway...
