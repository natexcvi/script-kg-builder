Tommy's taking the big test. Andy's monitoring the time. Deep 
silence, save for Tommy's pencilscribbling. A few oldtimers 
are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. Tommy 
tries to ignore them. Concentrate. 
Andy clears his throat. Time's up. Tommy puts his pencil down, 
ANDY 
Well? 
TOMMY 
Well. It's for shit. 
gets up in disgust 
Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my 
time with this bullshit! 
ANDY 
May not be as bad as you think. 
TOMMY 
It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' 
thing right! Might as well be in 
Chinese! 
ANDY 
We will see how the score comes out. 
TOMMY 
I will tell you how the goddamn 
score comes out... 
Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slamdunks it into the trash.
TOMMY 
Two points! Right there! There's 
your goddamn score! 
storms out 
Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 
times 5 is 25, fuck this place, 
fuck it! 
Tommy is gone. Red and others stare. Andy gets up, pulls the 
test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk.
