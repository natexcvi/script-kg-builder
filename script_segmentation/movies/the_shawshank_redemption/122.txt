 PRISON YARD  DUSK 1957 152
Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him.
RED 
Same old, same old. Thirty years. 
Jesus. When you say it like that... 
ANDY 
You wonder where it went. I wonder 
where ten years went. 
Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls 
a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red. 
ANDY 
Anniversary gift. Open it. 
Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a 
shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circusred. 
ANDY 
Had to go through one of your 
competitors. Hope you don't mind. 
Wanted it to be a surprise. 
RED 
It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you. 
ANDY 
You gonna play something? 
Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly 
RED 
Not today.
