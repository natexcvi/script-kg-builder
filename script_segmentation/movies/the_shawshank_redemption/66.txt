INT  CELLBLOCK FIVE  NIGHT  85
 CELLBLOCK FIVE  NIGHT 1949 85
Ernie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden 
Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN 
GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell 
ERNIE 
Heads up. They are tossin' cells. 
Word travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up
and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards 
pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. 
GUARD 
What kind'a contraband you hiding 
in there, boy? 
Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, 
mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets 
tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff. 
A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, 
shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible. 
NORTON 
Solitary. A week. Make sure he 
takes his Bible. 
CON 
Too goddamn dark to read down there.
NORTON 
Add another week for blasphemy. 
The man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up. 
NORTON 
Let's try the second tier. 
86  2ND TIER 86
Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random.
He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is
unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises. 
ANDY 
Good evening. 
Norton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the
cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy,
looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the
Bible out of Andy's hand. 
NORTON 
I am pleased to see you reading 
this. Any favorite passages? 
ANDY 
Watch ye therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh. 
NORTON 
smiles 
Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I have 
always liked that one. 
strolls the cell 
But I prefer I am the light of 
the world. He that followeth me 
shall not walk in darkness, but 
shall have the light of life. 
ANDY 
John. Chapter 8, verse 12. 
NORTON 
I hear you are good with numbers. 
How nice. A man should have a skill. 
HADLEY 
You wanna explain this? 
Andy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a
polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. 
ANDY 
It's called a rock blanket. It's 
for shaping and polishing rocks. 
Little hobby of mine. 
Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to
Norton. 
HADLEY 
Looks pretty clean. Some contraband 
here, nothing to get in a twist over. 
Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita. 
NORTON 
I can't say I approve of this... 
turns to Andy 
...but I suppose exceptions can 
always be made. 
Norton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and
locked. Norton pauses, turns back. 
NORTON 
I almost forgot. 
He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy. 
NORTON 
I had hate to deprive you of this. 
Salvation lies within. 
Norton and his men walk away. 
RED V.O. 
Tossin' cells was just an excuse. 
Truth is, Norton wanted to size 
Andy up.
