 ANDY'S CELL  NIGHT 1966 186
TIGHT 
Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing... 
RED V.O. 
Prison time is slow time. Sometimes 
it feels like stoptime. So you do 
what you can to keep going... 
...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. 
Sink. Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another 
TRAIN passing in the night... 
RED V.O. 
Some fellas collect stamps. Others 
build matchstick houses. Andy built 
a library. Now he needed a new project. 
Tommy was it. It was the same reason 
he spent years shaping and polishing 
those rocks. The same reason he hung 
his fantasy girlies on the wall... 
...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and 
finally to the place of honor on the wall... 
RED V.O. 
In prison, a man will do most 
anything to keep his mind occupied. 
...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins
fur bikini. Gorgeous. One Million Years, B. C.  SLOW PUSH IN,
RED V.O. 
By 1966...right about the time 
Tommy was getting ready to take his 
exams...it was lovely Racquel.
