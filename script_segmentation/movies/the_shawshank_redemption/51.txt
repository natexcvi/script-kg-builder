 ROOF  SHORTLY LATER 1949 60
The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. 
RED V.O. 
...wound up sitting in a row at ten 
o'clock in the morning, drinking icy 
cold Black Label beer courtesy of 
the hardest screw that ever walked 
a turn at Shawshank State Prison. 
HADLEY 
Drink up, boys. While it's cold. 
RED V.O. 
The colossal prick even managed to 
sound magnanimous. 
Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his
tongue and the warm sun on face. 
RED V.O. 
We sat and drank with the sun on 
our shoulders, and felt like free 
men. We could'a been tarring the 
roof of one of our own houses. We 
were the Lords of all Creation. 
He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others.
RED V.O. 
As for Andy, he spent that break 
hunkered in the shade, a strange 
little smile on his face, watching 
us drink his beer. 
HEYWOOD 
approaches with a beer 
Here's a cold one, Andy. 
ANDY 
No thanks. I gave up drinking. 
Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. 
RED V.O. 
You could argue he had done it to 
curry favor with the guards. Or 
maybe make a few friends among us 
cons. Me, I think he did it just to 
feel normal again...if only for a 
short while.
