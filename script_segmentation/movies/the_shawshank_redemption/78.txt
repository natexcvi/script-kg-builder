 PRISON LIBRARYANDY'S OFFICE  DAY 1952 99
The Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door.
RED V.O. 
The guards on the opposing teams 
all remembered to bring their W2's. 
ANDY 
Moresby Prison issued you that gun, 
but you actually had to pay for it? 
THE BATTER 
Damn right, and the holster too. 
ANDY 
See, that's all deductible. You get 
to write that off. 
RED V.O. 
Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R 
Block. In fact, he got so busy at 
tax time, he was allowed a staff. 
ANDY 
Say Red, could you hand me a stack 
of those 1040s? 
RED V.O. 
Got me out of the wood shop a month 
out of the year, and that was fine 
by me.
