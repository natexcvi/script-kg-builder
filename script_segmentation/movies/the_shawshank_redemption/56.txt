 AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR  NIGHT 1949 65
Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
Pete. Andy turns back  and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 
door open and drag him into  
66  THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66
 where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con
blinking at them through thick bifocals. 
BOGS 
Take a walk. 
PROJECTIONIST 
I have to change reels. 
BOGS 
I said fuck off. 
Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 
BOGS 
Ain't you gonna scream? 
Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. 
ANDY 
They had never hear me over that. 
Let's get this over with. 
Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind 
bench  and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel
of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.
ROOSTER 
Me first. 
ANDY 
Okay. 
Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing
it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. 
ROOSTER 
Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! 
Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his
knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
eightinch spike, gives him a good long look at it. 
BOGS 
Now I am gonna open my fly, and 
you are gonna swallow what I give 
you to swallow. And when you 
d mine, you gonna swallow 
Rooster's. You done broke his nose, 
so he ought to have somethin' to 
show for it. 
ANDY 
Anything you put in my mouth, 
you are going to lose. 
BOGS 
You don't understand. You do that, 
I will put all eight inches of this 
steel ii your ear. 
ANDY 
Okay. But you should know that 
sudden serious brain injury causes 
the victim to bite down. Hard. 
faint smile 
In fact, I understand the bitereflex 
is so strong the victim's jaws have 
to be pried open with a crowbar. 
The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the 
projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. 
BOGS 
You little fuck. 
Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking 
and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 
get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING 
AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. 
RED V.O. 
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's 
mouth, and neither did his friends. 
What they did do is beat him within 
an inch of his life...
