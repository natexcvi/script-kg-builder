 LIBRARY  DAY 1965 178
Tommy enters, the strut gone from his step. A little scared. 
He finds Andy filing library cards. 
RED V.O. 
Whatever it was, something lit a 
fire under that boy's ass. 
TOMMY 
I am thinkin' maybe I should try for 
high school equivalency. Hear you 
helped some fellas with that. 
ANDY 
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy. 
TOMNY 
tight 
I ain't no goddamn loser. 
ANDY 
That's a good start. If we do this, 
we do it all the way. One hundred 
percent. Nothing halfassed. 
Tommy thinks about it, nods. 
TOMMY

leans in, mutters

ANDY 
smiles 
Well. You have come to the right 
place then.
