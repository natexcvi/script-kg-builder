 JURY ROOM  DAY 1946 7
CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the 
next. These decent, Godfearing Christians are chowing down on 
a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, 
smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn. 
VOICE O.S. 
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... 
We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes.
