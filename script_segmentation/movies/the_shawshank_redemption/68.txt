 WARDEN NORTON'S OFFICE  DAY 1949 88
Andy is led in. Norton is at his desk doing paperwork. Andy's
eyes go to a framed needlepoint sampler on the wall behind 
him that reads HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON. 
NORTON 
My wife made that in church group. 
ANDY 
It's very pretty, sir. 
NORTON 
You like working in the laundry? 
ANDY 
No, sir. Not especially. 
NORTON 
Perhaps we can find something more 
befitting a man of your education.
