He didn't say that! 
BROOKS 
God is my witness. And Dekins, he 
just blinks for a second, then 
laughs his ass off. Afterward, he 
actually shook Andy's hand. 
HEYWOOD 
My ass! 
BROOKS 
Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about 
shit myself. All Andy needed was a 
suit and tie, a jiggly little hula 
girl on his desk, he would'a been 
Mister Dufresne, if you please. 
RED 
Makin' yourself some friends, Andy. 
ANDY 
I wouldn't say friends. I am a 
convicted murderer who provides 
sound financial planning. That's a 
wonderful pet to have. 
RED 
Got you out of the laundry, didn't 
it? 
ANDY 
Maybe it can do more than that.

How about expanding the library? 
Get some new books in there. 
HEYWOOD

BROOKS 
Son, I have had six wardens through 
here during my tenure, and I have 
learned one great immutable truth 
of the universe ain't one of 'em 
been born whose asshole don't 
pucker up tight as a snare drum 
when you ask for funds.
