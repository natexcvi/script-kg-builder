You did a stretch in Cashman too? 
TOMMY 
Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me 
tell you. Work programs, weekend 
furloughs. Not like here. 
SNOOZE 
Sounds like you done time all over 
New England. 
TOMNY 
Been in and out since I was 13. Name 
the place, chances are I been there. 
ANDY

the game stalls 
What I mean is, you don't seem to 
be a very good thief. Maybe you 
should try something else. 
TOMMY

ANDY 
wry glance to Red 
Everyone's innocent in here. Don't
