 NORTON'S OFFICE  NIGHT 1966 208
Andy's working away. Norton pokes his head in. 
NORTON 
Licketysplit. I wanna get home. 
ANDY 
Just about done, sir. 
We follow Norton to his wife's sampler. He swings it aside, 
works the combination dial, opens the wall safe. Andy moves up,
shoves in the black ledger and files. Norton shuts the safe. 
ANDY 
Three deposits tonight. 
Andy hands him the envelopes. Norton heads for the door. 
NORTON 
Get my stuff down t'laundry. And 
shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' 
like mirrors. 
pauses at door 
Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place 
just wasn't the same without you. 
Norton exits. Andy turns to the laundry. He opens the shoebox. 
Nice pair of dress shoes inside. He sighs, glances down at the 
old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet.
