 PRISON YARD  DAY 1966 193
Mail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and
the boys are parked on the bleachers. 
FLOYD 
A month in the hole. Longest damn 
stretch I ever heard of. 
TOMMY 
It's my fault. 
RED 
Like hell. You didn't pull the 
trigger, and you didn't convict him. 
HEYWOOD 
Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I 
mean for real innocent? 
Red nods 
Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in 
here? 
RED 
Since '47. Going on nineteen years. 
MAIL CALLER 
Thomas Williams! 
Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He
stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder. 
RED 
Board of Education. 
TOMMY 
The son of a bitch mailed it. 
RED 
Looks that way. You gonna open it 
or stick your thumb up your butt? 
TOMMY 
Thumb up my butt sounds better. 
He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter. 
TOMMY 
C amon, just throw it away. Will you 
please? Just throw it away? 
Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless. 
RED 
Well, shit.
