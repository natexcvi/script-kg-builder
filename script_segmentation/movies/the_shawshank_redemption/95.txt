INT  BROOKS' ROOM  NIGHT  116
 BROOKS' ROOM  NIGHT 1954 116
Dark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid.
Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place. 
BROOKS V.O. 
I have trouble sleeping at night. 
The bed is too big. I have bad 
dreams, like I am falling. I wake 
up scared. Sometimes it takes me a 
while to remember where I am.
