INT  SEWER PIPE  NIGHT  250
 SHAFT  NIGHT 1966 249
Andy squeezes through the hole headfirst, emerges to the waist,
He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 
conduit with his fingers. 
Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and 
almost plummets headfirst down the shaft. He dangles wildly 
upsidedown for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 
hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat 
scurries off, pissed. 
Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and
dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope the
plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,
He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3
his back against one wall and feet against the other, he 
starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for 
handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying
in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. 
He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. 
Pulls out the rockhammer and says a quick silent prayer. 
Raises the rockhammer high and swings it down with all his 
might. Once, twice  third time lucky. An enormous eruption 
of sewage cascades into the air as if rocketpropelled, the 
Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He 
turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming.
