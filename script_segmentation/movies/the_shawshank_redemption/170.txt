EXT  PRISON YARD  DAY  205
 PRISON YARD  DAY 1966 205
Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, 
poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. Red 
waits for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. 
Red hunkers down and joins him. Nothing is said for the 
longest time. And then, softly 
ANDY 
My wife used to say I am a hard man 
to know. Like a closed book. 
Complained about it all the time. 
pause 
She was beautiful. I loved her. But 
I guess I couldn't show it enough. 
softly 
I killed her, Red. 
Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence. 
ANDY 
I didn't pull the trigger. But I 
drove her away. That's why she 
died. Because of me, the way I am. 
RED 
That don't make you a murderer. Bad 
husband, maybe. 
Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his 
shoulder a squeeze. 
RED 
Feel bad about it if you want. But 
you didn't pull the trigger. 
ANDY 
No. I didn't. Someone else did, and 
I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. 
RED 
Bad luck? Jesus. 
ANDY 
It floats around. Has to land on 
somebody. Say a storm comes 
through. Some folks sit in their 
living rooms and enjoy the rain. 
The house next door gets torn out 
of the ground and smashed flat. It 
was my turn, that's all. I was in 
the path of the tornado. 
softly 
I just had no idea the storm would 
go on as long as it has. 
glances to him 
Think you will ever get out of here? 
RED 
Sure. When I got a long white beard 
and about three marbles left 
rolling around upstairs. 
ANDY 
Tell you where I had go. Zihuatanejo.
RED 
Zihuatanejo? 
ANDY 
Mexico. Little place right on the 
Pacific. You know what the Mexicans 
say about the Pacific? They say it 
has no memory. That's where I had 
like to finish out my life, Red. A 
warm place with no memory. Open a 
little hotel right on the beach. 
Buy some worthless old boat and fix 
it up like new. Take my guests out 
charter fishing. 
beat 
You know, a place like that, I had 
need a man who can get things. 
Red stares at Andy, laughs. 
RED 
Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on 
the outside. Been in here too long. 
I am an institutional man now. Like 
old Brooks Hatlen was. 
ANDY 
You underestimate yourself. 
RED 
Bullshit. In here I am the guy who 
can get it for you. Out there, all 
you need are Yellow Pages. I 
wouldn't know where to begin. 
derisive snort 
Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare 
me to death, somethin' that big. 
ANDY 
Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and 
I didn't shoot her lover, and 
whatever mistakes I made I have paid 
for and then some. That hotel and 
that boat...I don't think it's too 
much to want. To look at the stars 
just after sunset. Touch the sand. 
Wade in the water. Feel free. 
RED 
Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do 
that to yourself! Talking shitty 
pipedreams! Mexico's down there, 
and you are in here, and that's the 
way it is! 
ANDY 
You are right. It's down there, and 
I am in here. I guess it comes down 
to a simple choice, really. Get 
busy living or get busy dying. 
Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and
walks away. Red lunges to his feet. 
RED 
Andy? 
ANDY 
turns back 
Red, if you ever get out of here, 
do me a favor. There's this big 
hayfield up near Buxton. You know 
where Buxton is? 
RED 
nods 
Lots of hayfields there. 
ANDY 
One in particular. Got a long rock 
wall with a big oak at the north 
end. Like something out of a Robert 
Frost poem. It's where I asked my 
MORE 
ANDY cont. 
wife to marry me. We had gone for a 
picnic. We made love under that 
tree. I asked and she said yes. 
beat 
Promise me, Red. If you ever get 
out, find that spot. In the base of 
that wall you will find a rock that 
has no earthly business in a Maine 
hayfield. A piece of black volcanic 
glass. You will find something buried 
under it I want you to have. 
RED 
What? What's buried there? 
ANDY 
You will just have to pry up that 
rock and see. 
Andy turns and walks away.
