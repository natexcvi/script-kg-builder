EXT  PLYMOUTH  NIGHT  4
 PLYMOUTH  NIGHT 1946 4
His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to 
the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 
He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he 
gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more 
frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. 
WOMAN O.S. 
Oh god...oh god...oh god... 
Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in 
orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He 
shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 
It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 
is the shallow gasping and panting of postcoitus. We hear 
languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. 
WOMAN O.S. 
Oh god...that's sooo good...you are 
the best...the best I ever had... 
Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like 
much of a killer now he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.
