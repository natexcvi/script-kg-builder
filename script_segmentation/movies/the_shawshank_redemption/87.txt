 SHAWSHANK PRISON  MAIN GATE  DAY 1954 108
TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It 
swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap 
suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. 
Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks 
back. Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing 
him off. The massive gate closes, wiping them from view.
