 ANDY'S CELL  NIGHT 1953 101
Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a fourinch length of 
quartz. It's a beautifullycrafted chess piece in the shape of 
a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. 
He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 
four pieces already there a king, a queen, and two bishops. 
He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face.
