INT  VERTICAL SHAFT  DAY  224
 VERTICAL SHAFT  DAY 1966 224
Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you 
imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this 
particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark
tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining
his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. 
RED V.O. 
It was his third day on the job. 
RORY 
Warden? There's a space here 
between the walls 'bout three feet 
across! Smells pretty damn bad! 
NORTON O.S. 
I don't care what it smells like! 
HADLEY O.S. 
Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! 
Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel 
and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his 
light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time. 
RORY 
Hoowhee! Smell's gettin' worse! 
NORTON O.S. 
Never mind, I said! Just keep going! 
RORY 
Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In 
fact, it smells just like shit. 
His feet touch the ground  or what he assumed was the 
ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He 
sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it. 
RORY 
Oh God, that's what it is, it's 
shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me 
out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh 
shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd!
