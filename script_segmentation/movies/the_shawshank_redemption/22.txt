INT  RED'S CELL  NIGHT  26
 RED'S CELL  NIGHT 1947 26
Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head,
peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep. 
HEYWOOD O.S. 
FatAss...oh, FaaaatAss. Talk to 
me, boy. I know you are in there. I 
can hear you breathin'. Now don't 
you listen to these nitwits, hear?
