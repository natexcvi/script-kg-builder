 FOODWAY MARKET  DAY 1954 114
Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging 
groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. 
WOMAN 
Make sure he doublebags. Last time 
your man didn't doublebag and the 
bottom near came out. 
MANAGER 
You doublebag like the lady says, 
understand? 
BROOKS 
Yes sir, doublebag, surely will. 
BROOKS V.O. 
It's hard work. I try to keep up, 
but my hands hurt most of the time. 
I don't think the store manager 
likes me very much.
