INT  GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE  DAY  131
 GUARD STATIONOUTER OFFICE  DAY 1955 131
Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, 
sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the 
machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. 
He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the 
platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The 
needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting 
and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its 
beauty. It is Deutino Che soave zeffiretto, a duet sung by 
Susanna and the Contessa.
