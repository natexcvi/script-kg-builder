INT  COURTROOM  DAY  5
 COURTROOM  DAY 1946 5
THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 
palefaced and stupefied. 
D.A. O.S. 
Mr. Dufresne, describe the 
confrontation you had with your 
wife the night she was murdered. 
ANDY DUFRESNE 
is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones 
ANDY 
It was very bitter. She said she 
was glad I knew, that she hated all 
the sneaking around. She said she 
wanted a divorce in Reno. 
D.A. 
What was your response? 
ANDY 
I told her I would not grant one. 
D.A. 
refers to his notes 
I will see you in Hell before I see
you in Reno. Those were the words 
you used, Mr. Dufresne, according 
to the testimony of your neighbors. 
ANDY 
If they say so. I really don't 
remember. I was upset. 
  2ND  UP 
D.A. 
What happened after you and your 
wife argued? 
ANDY 
She packed a bag and went to stay 
with Mr. Quentin. 
D.A. 
Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the 
Falmouth Hills Country Club. The 
man you had recently discovered was 
her lover. 
Andy nods 
Did you follow her? 
ANDY 
I went to a few bars first. Later, 
I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's 
home and confront them. They 
weren't there...so I parked my car 
in the turnout...and waited. 
D.A. 
With what intention? 
ANDY 
I am not sure. I was confused. Drunk. 
I think mostly I wanted to scare them. 
D.A. 
You had a gun with you? 
ANDY 
Yes. I did. 
  3RD  UP 
D.A. 
When they arrived, you went up 
to the house and murdered them? 
ANDY 
No. I was sobering up. I realized 
she wasn't worth it. I decided to 
let her have her quickie divorce. 
D.A. 
Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 
caliber divorce, wrapped in a 
handtowel to muffle the shots, 
isn't that what you mean? And then 
you shot her lover! 
ANDY 
I did not. I got back in the car 
and drove home to sleep it off. 
Along the way, I stopped and threw 
my gun into the Royal River. I feel 
I have been very clear on this point. 
D.A. 
Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, 
though, is the part where the 
cleaning woman shows up the next 
morning and finds your wife and her 
lover in bed, riddled with .38 
caliber bullets. Does that strike 
you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. 
Dufresne, or is it just me? 
ANDY 
softly 
Yes. It does. 
D.A. 
I am sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't 
think the jury heard that. 
ANDY 
Yes. It does. 
D.A. 
Does what? 
ANDY 
Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 
D.A. 
On that, sir, we are in accord... 
 ! 4TH  UP 
D.A. 
You claim you threw your gun into 
the Royal River before the murders 
took place. That's rather convenient. 
ANDY 
It's the truth. 
D.A. 
You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? 
He and his men dragged that river 
for three days and nary a gun was 
found. So no comparison can be made 
between your gun and the bullets 
taken from the bloodstained corpses 
of the victims. That's also rather 
convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? 
ANDY 
faint, bitter smile 
Since I am innocent of this crime, 
sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient 
the gun was never found. 
  STH  UP
