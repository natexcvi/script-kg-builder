INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, BACKSTAGE  CONTINUOUS

A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED
MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air. IT IS
BORDEN.
A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle. He
shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down
towards the stage...
On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling. Looming
over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE. Borden
STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage.
Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the
vast machine. As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various
features of the metal and glass apparatus.
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers to the side of the
stage, Borden slips through the gas at the side of the
CURTAINS
