INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE  CONTINUOUS

Sarah turn to face Borden. Deperate.
SARAH
I can't live like this!
BORDEN
ANGRY
What do you want from me!
Sarah pauses. Catches her breath.
SARAH
QUIET
I want you to be honest with me. No
tricks, no lies, no secrets.
Borden calms. Looks into her eyes. Nods.
SARAH CONT'D
Do you love me?
Borden looks into her eyes. Sincere.
BORDEN
Not today.
Sarah takes this in. Borden watches, helpless.
SARAH
WHISPERS
Thank you.
Borden watches her turn away from him.
