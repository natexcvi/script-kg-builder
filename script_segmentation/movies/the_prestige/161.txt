INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE  EVENING

Olivia and Borden are seated across from each other, finishing
their meal. Olivia watches Borden eat.
OLIVIA
You haven't spopken about her, Freddy.
Not once.
BORDEN
Who?
OLIVIA
Don't be cruel.
BORDEN
Why would I talk about her to you?
OLIVIA
Because she was part of your life
and now she's gone.
Borden says nothing.
OLIVIA CONT'D
She wanted to meet me the day before
she killed herself. Said she had
something to tell me about you.
LOOKS AWAY
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring
myself to face her.
looks at Borden
What would she have said, I wonder?
BORDEN
SNAPS
You want the truth about me, Olivia?
she nods, wary
I never loved Sarah.
OLIVIA
APPALLED
You married her, had a child with
HER
BORDEN
Part of me loved her. But part of
me didn't. The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here now. I
love you. That is the truth that
matters.
Olivia tosses her napkin on her plate.
OLIVIA
You could be sitting in some other
restaurant talking to some other
woman about me that way. It's unhuman
to be so cold.
Borden watches her rise from the table. She looks at him.
OLIVIA CONT'D
By the way, have you seen who's opened
at the Pantages?
Borden shakes head
The Great Danton.
BORDEN
He's back?
OLIVIA
After two years. And he has a new
trick. They are saying it's the best
that London's ever seen.
Borden cannot hide his reaction.
OLIVIA CONT'D
If you could see the look on your
face, Professor. You should go to
him you deserve each other.
Olivia smiles at him and leaves.
