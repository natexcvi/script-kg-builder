EXT. CANAL  AFTERNOON

Borden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and
tries to hop up into his lap. Laughing, he helps her up.
JESS
Are we going to the zoo this
afternoon, daddy?
BORDEN
Daddy's got some business this
afternoon.
JESS
But you promised.
BORDEN
Did I?
Jess nods at him, solemly.
BORDEN CONT'D
Then go to the zoo we shall.
Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at.
BORDEN CONT'D
gestures to newspaper
Who's that?
A large advertisement features a picture of Borden The
Professor England's premiere magician!
JESS
That's you, daddy?
Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands.
BORDEN
Daddy has some errands to run. I will
be back before you know it, so get
ready.
Borden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding
his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her.
She reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour.
Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying.
SARAH
We each have our vices.
Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes.
BORDEN
Sarah. Whatever you may think, your
only competitions for my affections
is my little girl. I love you. I
will always love you, and you alone.
She looks into his eyes. Fascinated.
SARAH
You mean it today.
BORDEN
Absolutely.
SARAH
That makes it so much harder when
you don't.
She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves.
