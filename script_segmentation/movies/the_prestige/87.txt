INT. EMPIRE THEATRE  MOMENTS LATER

Angier and Olivia sit in the front row. Cutter beckons Root
onstage. He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage
costume. he TRIPS on his way across the stage.
ANGIER
All I have to do is keep myself
stinking drunk all the time and no
one will be able to tell the
difference.
TER
A little faith, sir. Could you favor
us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
Root picks himself up and dusts himself off.
Suddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER. he is channeling everything
from his facial expressions to his walk. Angier nods,
starting to believe this might work. The illusion is PERFECT 
till he opens his mouth.
ROOT
You would drink, too, if you know
the world half so well as I do.
Angier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different
angles. Root starts APING his every movement. Olivia starts
laughing. Angier is getting uncomfortable.
ROOT CONT'D
Did you think you were unique, Mr.
Angier? I have been Cassar. I have
been Faust. How difficult could it
possibly be to play 'The Great
Danton?'
TER
You can go back to being yourself.
Root. For free..
Root looks challengingly at both men.
ROOT
I had rather be him, for now. I find
it amusing.
Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner
that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from
thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia.
TER
Root has to keep a low profile
anyone sees him the game's up.
ANGIER
ING ROOT
I don't know how you do these things,
Cutter. I am not sure I want to know.
TER
Have you thought about what we should
call the trick?
ANGIER
No point being coy. Borden calls
his trick 'The Transported Man'?
Cutter nods.
