EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN  MORNING

Olivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to
Borden. She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss,
but he backs away.
OLIVIA
What is it. Freddy?
BORDEN
Please don't call me that. It's
nothing, just... sometimes things
seem... wrong.
Olivia looks at him. Cold.
OLIVIA
Freddy, I have told you before. When
you are with me, you are with me.
Leave your family at home where they
belong.
BORDEN
I am trying, Olivia. Please.
OLIVIA
I will get dressed.
Borden watches her move down the hall.
OLIVIA O.S. CONT'D
I saw Fallon hanging around my house
again, after you left.
Olivia comes back in, halfdressed.
OLIVIA CONT'D
There's something about him I don't
trust.
BORDEN
You trust me?
off her look
Then trust Fallon he protects the
things I care about.
