EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN  DAY

Sarah sits by herself at a table for two. Borden ENTERS
with a swagger, Olivia beside him, Fallon behind. The MAITRE
D' hurries over, signaling WAITERS. Sarah looks up.
UNCOMFORTABLE.
SARAH
I didn't know we had be joined for
dinner.
BORDEN
Absolutely. We are celebrating.
The Waiters spirit another table and chairs to join Sarah's.
Borden pulls out a chair for Olivia.
SARAH
Miss Wenscombe. Mr.Fallon.
Olivia smiles cheerfully. Fallon nods, embarrassed.
BORDEN
to wine waiter
Champagne. Your finest
SARAH
What are we celebrating, dear?
BORDEN
Well, we have hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?
OLIVIA
What trick, Freddy?
SARAH
BRITTLE
Yes, Freddy. What trick?
The WAITER presents a bottle of champagne. Borden nods
without looking at it.
BORDEN
LOUD
I am going to bury myself alive.
Every night. Then someone's going
to come along and dig me up!
OTHER DINERS are glancing over. The waiter uncorks the bottle
with a muffled POP and pours champagne into Borden's glass.
SARAH
TO WAITER
I am not sure my husband needs
BORDEN
Who are you to tell me what?!
Awkward silence. Olivia shifts in her seat.
OLIVIA
PERHAPS
SARAH
Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort
Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's
being a bore. I see no reason for
the two of you to suffer as well.
Fallon is on his feet, pulling back Olivia's chair.
OLIVIA
Goodnight, Mrs.Borden. Goodnight,
Freddy.
They leave. Borden glares at his wife.
SARAH
Freddy?
BORDEN
It's my name.
SARAH
Not at home.
BORDEN
I am not always at home.
Sarah is clearly on the verge of tears.
SARAH
Alfred, why are you being like this?
Borden, seeing her fistress, softnes.
BORDEN
Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today.
I thought I had lost something very
precious to me.
SARAH
What?
Borden looks at her speechless. Shrugs helplessly.
SARAH CONT'D
I see. More secrets.
BORDEN
Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our
life.
Sarah brushes away a tear.
SARAH
When you are like this, Alfred, I am
not seeing the real you. You are
treating me like your audience.
Performing. I can't live with that.
Borden just sits there. Offering nothing.
