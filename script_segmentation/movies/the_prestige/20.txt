EXT. TRAIN STATION  DUSK

No platform, no office, no sign. Just an electric streetlight
which, as Angier watches, FLICKERS ON. Angier, leaning
heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at
it as he's never seen one before.
VOICE O.S.
Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado
Springs.
Angier looks back and smiles. A driver is looking down
expectantly from atop a STAGECOACH. Angier hands his cane
up to the driver nd , with some difficulty, hitches his way
up to the roof of the rig. As he does, the town of Colorado
Springs rises into view, a few hundred yards down the road,
lit brightly with ELECTRIC STREETLIGHTS.
ANGIER
DISBELIEF
The whole town has electricity?
The driver nods and WHIPS the horses into action.
