Angier turns to Cutter.
TER
The trick is too good  too simple
the audience harly knows what they have
seen.
ANGIER
He's a dreadful magician.
TER
He's a wonderfull magician he's a
dreadful showman. He doesn't know
how to dress it up, how to sell the
trick.
ANGIER
How does he do it?
TER
He uses a double.
ANGIER
SHAKES HEAD
It's not that simple. This is a
complex illusion.
TER
You think that because you don't
know the method. It's a double who
comes out at the end. It's the only
way.

The same man comes out of the second
cabinet. I promise you.
OLIVIA

They both turn to look at Olivia.
OLIVIA CONT'D
He wears padded gloves to hide his
damaged fingers, but if you look
closely you can tell.
Angier looks at Cutter.
ANGIER
He doesn't know how to sell his trick
to an audience. But I do.
TER
NODS
It would give us our climax.
ANGIER
The man stole my life. I am going to
steal his trick.

We will have to find someone who can
look like you on a stage.
ANGIER
He doesn't use a double
TER
IMPACIENT
I don't know how Borden does it,
Robert. So either you wait for Borden
to retire and buy his secret, or you
can listen to how I would do this
trick.
ANGIER NODS

you a bloody good double.
