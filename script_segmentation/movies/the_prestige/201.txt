Angier PEERS down the row of glass boxes with the lantern.
ANGIER
TENSE
TER?
Angier FREEZES. He can hear a small THUD, THUD, THUD getting
closer, approaching from the darkness...
Angier FLINCHES as a RUBBER BALL bounces into the light
Angier DROPS his cane to CATCH the ball. He turns it around
in his hands, confused.
Light EXPLODES around him as a GUNSHOT rings out.
Angier stands for a moment, confused, staring at the ball,
then COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching at his stomach.
Fallon's BOWLER HAT breaks into the circle of light. he is
holding a smoking pistol...
Angier drops the ball and it rolls across the floor, coming
to rest at Fallon's feet. But it is not Fallon's gloved
hand that picks up the ball
it is a MUTILATED HAND, WITH 2 12 FINGERS MISSING. Angier
LOOKS UP
ALFRED BORDEN REMOVES THE BOWLER HAT AND TAKES A BOW.

Borden shakes his head.
Realization sweeps over Angier like a nightmare.
