INT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT

Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal
that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city.
Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for
him  Fallon.
Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it.
BORDEN
More shopping. She doesn't like the
smell of money, doesn't she?
Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper.
BORDEN CONT'D
The little lady wants to visit the
Zoo, I thought you could take her.
I will do it tomorrow, if not.
looks at his feet
Sarah... she knows. At least, she

looks at Fallon,
PLEADING
Help me with her. Try and convince
her that I love her. Please.
Borden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes
off down the path. Fallon sets off in the opposite direction.
