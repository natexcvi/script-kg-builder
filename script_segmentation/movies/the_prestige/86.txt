Oof. Couldn't you find a softer

ANGIER
SMILES
It's not for sleeping on.
Olivia looks around the below stage area.
OLIVIA
And Root goes up through there?
She gestures at a LIFT twenty feet away with a TRAP DOOR
MECHANISM above it. Angier nods. Olivia looks at Angier.
OLIVIA CONT'D
It's going to be amazing, Robert.
ANGIER
It has to be. Borden's trick is
getting noticed. The place was packed
today.
Olivia looks at him strangely.
OLIVIA
You went and saw his show again?
Angier looks away, embarrassed.
OLIVIA CONT'D
You becoming obsessed, Robert.
TER O.S.

Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door.
