INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP  DAY

Angier is sitting at a worktable, pensive. He is moving one
hand across the other, making a ROSE appear and disappear.
The windows have been WHITEWASHED and the room has filled
with an array of magical apparati cabinets, costumes, props.
On the other side of the room Cutter watches as OLIVIA
WENSCOMBE, 20s, equal parts grace and mischief, squeezes
herself into a tall cabinet, looking past Cutter to Angier.
OLIVIA
What's so hard about this?
Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in
the floor, revealing a tiny chamber.
TER
In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point
meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit.
Olivia shrugs and hands Cutter her hat, then her thick skirts,
and folds herself into the bottom of the box.
TER CONT'D
Breathe as little as possible.
Cutter closes the lid over her and walks over to Angier.
TER CONT'D
Not much experience , but she knows
the basics. She knows how to present
herself and a pretty assistant's the
most effective from of misdirection.
Angier nods. There is a small SNEEZE from inside the cabinet.
TER CONT'D
SMILES
I suppose I should let her out.
