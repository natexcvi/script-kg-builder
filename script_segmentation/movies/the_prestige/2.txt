INT. SCALA THEATRE, LONDON  NIGHT

A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN,
his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air.
TER V.O.
...or a man.
A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He
shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
TER V.O. CONT'D
He show you this object, and pledges
to you its utter normality...
Bearbed Man and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant
down towards the stage...
On which stands the magician, leaning on his cane, smiling.
This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is
a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE.
TER V.O. CONT'D
Perhaps he asks you to inspect it...
Bearbed Man, FASCINATED, and other Volunteers look over
the vast machine. As angier GESTURES theatrically at the
various features of the metal and glass apparatus.
TER V.O. CONT'D
...to see that it is indeed real...
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers off the stage, Bearded
Man slips through the gap at the side of the curtains
TER V.O. CONT'D
...unaltered...
