EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON  DAY

OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN
of the guard walks out to greet him.
CAPTAIN
I am going to have to ask you to turn
out your pockets.
Owens raises his eyebrows.
CAPTAIN CONT'D
Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw
his show in Manchester last year
where he vanished into thin air
he's convinced he will try an escape.
Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet.
They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms
over them.
A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed
absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES
begin cattlecalling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up
to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.
CAPTAIN CONT'D
I told him the only way Borden's
going to disappear is if I leave him
out with the others immates.
At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a
thick eye hook set into the ground.
CAPTAIN CONT'D
TO WARDERS
Check the locks. Twice.
They check the locks. Then retreat to allow privacy. The
Captain marches away. Borden looks at Owens. Bored.
OWENS
My name is Owens I am a solicitor.
Borden says nothing.
OWENS CONT'D

accomplished amateur magician and
historian of magic

BORDEN
COLD
How much for my tricks?
OWENS
Five thousand pounds.
BORDEN
Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer the
money's for him.
OWENS
I did. He offered to sell all of
your tricks... except the most
valuable one  The Transported Man.
BORDEN
I had never forgive myself for selling
my greatest trick.
Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
OWENS
Even for your daughter?
Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive.
OWENS CONT'D
If the newspapers are right, and
you are for the drop, your daughter's
going to need looking after
BORDEN
Fallon can take care of
OWENS
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
even more obscure than your own?
The court have already motioned to
have the girl removed from his care.
No, the girl is to be an orphan.
I have been to the work house...
Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs.
OWENS CONT'D
It's better than this.
Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden.
OWENS CONT'D
I am offering you a way to warp up
your affairs with dignity, and I am
offering your daughter a future. As
Lord Caldlow's ward she will want
for nothing. Ever.
hands him a card
Think it over.
Borden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX.
OWENS CONT'D
Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this
produces a leather
BOUND JOURNAL
As a show of good faith. He thought
it might be of interest.
A SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal, flicks through it.
OWENS CONT'D
Robert Angier's diary... It includes
the time he spent in Colorado learning
your trick...
Sullen hands the journal to Borden. Borden takes it.
BORDEN
Angier never learned my trick.
OWENS
Really? When he returned from
Colorado he mounted a version of the
Transported Man that the papers said
was better, even...
WITH RELISH
Than your original.
BORDEN
ACID
If you want Angier's secret you can
dig him up and ask him for yourself.
Borden TURNS, dragging the Warders with him.
OWENS
I want your secret, Mr.Borden...
LOUDER
Consider your daughter!
