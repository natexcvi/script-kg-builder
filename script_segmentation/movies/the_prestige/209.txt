INT. ABANDONED THEATRE  DAY  FLASHBACK

Borden stares at his mutilated hand clasping the rubber ball.
ANGIER
What about Olivia? And your wife?
BORDEN
We each loved one of them. We each
had half a full life. Enough for
us, but not for them.
Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes.
BORDEN CONT'D
Sacrifice, Robert that's the price
of a good trick.
Borden looks down at Angier with contempt.
BORDEN CONT'D
But you wouldn't know anything about
that, would you?
Angier is dying. He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice
is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him.
ANGIER
VERY QUIET
I have made sacrificies.
BORDEN
It takes nothing to steal someone
else's work.
ANGIER
It takes everything.
