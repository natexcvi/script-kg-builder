INT. ABANDONED THEATRE  DAY

Borden STOPS at the ladder. He notices the shadows from the
burning oil playing on the walls...
TER V.O.
Now you are looking for the secret...
Borden turns slowly to look back into the cellar, PEERING
into the flickering light of the burning lamp oil.
TER CONT'D
But you won't find it...
Borden stares back into the cellar. What he sees puts a
look on his face that is beyond words
LARGE GLASS TANKS. DOZENS OF THEM. ROW AFTER ROW STRECHING
INTO THE CAVERNOUS CELLAR.
TER CONT'D
...because you don't really want to
know...
FLOATING IN BACH AND EVERY TANK, DRESSED IN ROTTING STAGE
CLOTHES, IS YET ANOTHER ROBERT ANGIER.
