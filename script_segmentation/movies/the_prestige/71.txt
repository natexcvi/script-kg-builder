INT. PRISON LIBRARY, NEWGATE PRISON  DAY

Te library is long and titled, with two long tables. It
looks as if it used to be a latrine.
Borden sits at a table. Writing on a stack of notepaper.
His arms have been unbound, but long chains runs from his
ellbows to where Sullen Gaurd sits smoking, craning his nek
to read Borden's writing.
SULLEN
Let me see?
Sullen SNATCHES up the papers. Borden makes no move to stop
him. The top sheet is a sketch of a cabinet.
SULLEN CONT'D
I am going to know all of the
Professor's secrets.
BORDEN
SMILING
Only if I teach you how to read.
Sullen mashes the papers into a ball and drops them.
SULLEN
Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't
helped you get out of here
TUGS CHAINS
Have they? Or can't you open real
locks, Professor?
BORDEN
Perhaps I am just biding my time.
Perhaps one day I will just hold up my
HAND
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL in front of Sullen's face.
Sullen stares.
BORDEN CONT'D
get you attention. Then quietly
SAY
WHISPERS
are you wacthing closely... perhaps
say a magic word or two... then I will
be gone.
Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's
feet. Sullebn LAUGHS as Borden SCRABBLEs around his ankles
to retrieve the ball.
SULLEN
How had you get so famous, then?
Borden STANDS.
BORDEN
Magic.
Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet
to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other
PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.
SULLEN
Oi, Borden, get back here!
Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW. Another
warder CRACKS Borden over the head with a TRUNCHEON. Sullen,
now free, KICKS Borden in the ribs.
 ON AN ADVERTISSIMENT the professor has DEFIED DEATH
to return with a new SPECTACULAR! Pull wider
