INT. STAGE  CONTINUOUS

Angier steps to the table center stage. Pulls out the bird
cage. There are one or two groans from the audience. Angier
SMILES as he produces a DOVE with a FLOURISH.
ANGIER
You have seen this one before?
HECKLER O.S.
Seen 'em all before, mate!
Laughter.
ANGIER
Well, I will make it a little harder,
shall I?
In the wings, Cutter smiles and nods at Angier's showmanship.
ANGIER CONT'D
Two volunteers, please. A lady and
a gentleman to hold this cage with
me...
Hands go up. Olivia pulls an ELEGANT LADY from the audience.
ANGIER CONT'D
I will perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves or
by any other audience anywhere in
the worth...
Olivi brings Elegant Lady onto the stage along with a RED
BEARDED MAN. The audience is getting interested. Angier is
on role...
ANGIER CONT'D
Any magician can make this cage
disappear... that's why I will ask
this good lady and fine gentleman to
place their hands firmly on the
cage...
Olivia guides Elegant Lady's hands onto the sides of the
cage. Redbeard places a hand underneath the cage.
ANGIER CONT'D
...to ensure that no trickery
whatsover is employed.
Angier RAISES the bird cage. The audience is RAPT.
Red beard's other hand appears on the top of the cage it is
MUTILATED, missing fingers.
Angier FREEZES looks up at Red Beard... IT IS BORDEN
Borden SMILES as he WORMS his little finger into the cage
mechanism...
SNAP! HALP THE CAGE WHIPS UP ANGIER'S SLEEVE THE OTHER
HALF COLLAPSES ON THE DOVE AND THE ELEGANT LADY'S FINGERS

THE AUDIENCE GOES CRAZY
Borden smiles at Angier through his bloodspattered fake
beard and retreats into the chaos surrounding the Elefant
Lady who is still SCREAMING as Angier tries to free her
fingers from the mechanism.
