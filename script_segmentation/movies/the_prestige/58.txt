INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP  DAY

Angier and Cutter have their hands on the bird cage.
ANGIER
...THREE!
The bird cage BREAKS APART, WHIPPING UP ANGIER'S FOREARMS.
WHERE SLEEVES WOULD BE, YANKED BY THE HARNESS. Angier smiles.
ANGIER CONT'D
Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
TER
And the best part...
Cutter reaches to Angier's armpit... pulls up the DOVE,
HANGING BY ITS ANKLE, ALIVE.
ANGIER
Thought you said I had to get my
hands dirty.
TER
Someday, perhaps you will. I needed
to know that you can.
