INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE  EVENING

Now it's TER standing in the audience, watching. Onstage,
Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again.
ANGIER V.O.
It was the greatest magic trick I
have ever seen.
Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
one of the cabinets. It's empty. He S it again and
crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way.
At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the
door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves
the door open.
He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across
the stage...
Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door.
With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball
continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height...
Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE
happens.
THE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT,
CATCHING THE BALL.
Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden. The audience is
BEMUSED. Finally, a trickle of applause.
