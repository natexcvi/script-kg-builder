INT. DRESSING ROOM  EVENING

Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess.
Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table.
OLIVIA
TOAST
To our achivement.
They drink.
TER
The manager said he's never seen a
reaction like it.
Angier smiles, rueful.
ANGIER
At least he got to see it. I spent
the ovation hidden under the stage.
No one cares about the man who
disappears, the man who goes into
the box. They care about the man
who comes out the other side.
OLIVIA
I care about the man in the box.
Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.
ANGIER
Thank you.
TO TER
Maybe we could switch before the
trick. That way I could be the
Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
TER
SHAKES HEAD
The antecipation of the trick is
everything it needs your showmanship
to built suspense. If Root opens
his mouth, it's all over he can't
introduce the trick.
ROOT O.S.
of course I can. I am the Great
Danton.
They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.
TER
Root, you bloody fool, get that
costume and makeup off right now,
anyone could walk in here!
Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet. He grabs his collar
and turns to Angier and Olivia.
TER CONT'D
Congratulation, all.
Cutter DRAGS Root out. Olivia slides onto the makeup table.
ANGIER
I suppose I should get more rest.
OLIVIA
Life is not full of these moments,
Robbie.
Olivia pours him some more champagne.
OLIVIA CONT'D
We have worked hard for this, and we
need to celebrate properly.
Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile. She pulls him
in closer and they KISS. She wraps her legs around him.
They kiss again.
Angier pulls back.
OLIVIA CONT'D
What's wrong?
SOFTLY
It is your wife?
Angier shakes his head, distracted.
ANGIER
The trick isn't good enough.
Olivia stares at him.
OLIVIA
Didn't you see the audience?
ANGIER
No.
OLIVIA
Well, they loved it.
ANGIER
It's not as good as his trick.
OLIVIA
Borden's trick is nothing compared
to ours. He doesn't have any style
ANGIER
He doesn't have to spend the finale
hiding under the stage.
Angier rises, turning out of her embrace.
ANGIER CONT'D
I need to know how he does it.
OLIVIA
Why?
ANGIER
So that I can do it better.
Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.
ANGIER CONT'D
I need you to go and work for him.
OLIVIA
Work for him? Are you joking
ANGIER
You will be my spy.
OLIVIA
TAKEN ABACK
We just got our start and you want
me to leave?
ANGIER
It's how we advance.
Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.
ANGIER CONT'D
Think of it, Olivia... we have got
people excited about Cutter's version
of the trick imagine what we could
do with the real illusion. We will
have the greatest magic act anyone's
ever seen.
OLIVIA
FRUSTATED
He knows I work for you.
ANGIER
Exactly why he will want to hire you.
He will want my secrets.
OLIVIA
Why would he trust me?
Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.
ANGIER
Because you are going to tell him the
truth.
