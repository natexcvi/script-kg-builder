INT. ABANDONED THEATRE  MOMENTS LATER

Angier slowly climbs down a ladder from the hole to join
Cutter in the darkness below.
Cutter is standing next to the platform and the crate. The
only night comes from a LANTERN Angier is carrying. We can
see only a small flicker of the high moldy walls of the
cellar, but it is a large open space.
TER
No room left you couldn't have
acommodated 100 performances.
ANGIER
It's a good thing I retired early
then.
Angier puts the lattern and his cane on the lif of the crate
and the two men heft ir off the platform.
ANGIER CONT'D
We will put it down the end.
Angier and Cutter move into the darkness with the crate.
From the small pool of light afforded by the lattern, we can
see that they are navigating their way through a large space
filled with LARGE GLASS BOXES.
They arrive at the end and set the crate down.
TER
I will go mix the cement.
Cutter looks at Angier, cold.
TER CONT'D
Take a minute to consider your
achiviement.
Cutter turns.
ANGIER
Cutter, I tried not to involve you.
Cutter looks at Angier. Nods. Then disappears into darkness.
