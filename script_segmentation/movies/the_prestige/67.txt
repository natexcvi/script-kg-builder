INT. AUDITORIUM, ALBERT HALL  CONTINUOUS

The hall is completely darkened, but bright blue FLASHES
illuminate ANGIER as he pushes his way to a seat.
On the stage, a tall rod capped with a steel ball is
transmitting a steady, sparking stream of electricity onto a
matched ball across the stage.
A FIGURE walks around from behind the machine and the audience
GASPS as a shower of sparks bounce off of his immaculate
evening wear. This is TESLA but Angier is too far from the
stage to get a good look at him.
TESLA
With a system like this I could have
the entire city electrified whitin
two years.
The audience breaks into LAUGHTER. The spell is broken.
Tesla must be a lunatic.
TESLA CONT'D
Mr. Edison's direct current system
is flawed and dangerous. With my
alternating current devices
Someone from the audience chimes in
AUDIENCE MEMBER
YELLS
Fraud.
Angier turns to look. The man who called out is leaving
he's not alone. Angier FREEZES, staring down at aisle
Borden is sitting there, RAPT, lit by FLASHES from the
machinery on stage. As tesla continues his demonstration,
Angier STARES at Borden.
