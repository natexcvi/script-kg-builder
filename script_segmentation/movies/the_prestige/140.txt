The BELLBOYS wrestle with Angier's cases as Angier walks to
the reception desk. The manager smiles up at him.

Angier takes out his wallet and begins laying down bills.
MANAGER CONT'D
We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave
as well. He was very good to Colorado

MANAGER CONT'D
Mr. Angier?
ANGIER TURNS
I didn't feel it was necessary to
tell the other men about the box.
Angier stops.

What box?
The manager smiles.
