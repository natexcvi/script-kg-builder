INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE  CONTINUOUS

Sarah is WILD, eyes red, hair a mess. Utterly DISTRAUGHT
Borden is trying to calm her.
BORDEN
Sarah, it's not true! I have told you
Olivia means nothing to me!
SARAH
I will go yo her! I know what you
really are, Alfred!
BORDEN
QUIETLY FIRM
Sarah. You can't do that.
