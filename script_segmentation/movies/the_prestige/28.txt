INT. THEATRE, CONVENT GARDEN  EVENING

Borden watches from the wings. Onstage, a magician, Virgil,
locks a CANARY into a cage then covers the cage with a SHAWL.
Borden notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in the front row with
a little BOY who is watching Virgil's act, spellbound.
Virgil SLAMS the SHAWL down onto the table, as if nothing
were beneath it, then WHIPS it away BIRD and CAGE are gone.
The little BOY begins to WAIL and CRY.
Borden watches as the young woman tries to make him stop.
Virgil takes the flower from his lapel, covers it with the
shawl, and SNAPS it away the flower has become the CANARY.
The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little
boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY. Virgil takes bows and
walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage.
As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols
the bird in front of the boy.
BORDEN
Look he's all right. He's fine.
BOY
SNIFFS
But where's his brother?
Borden is at a loss. He turns to the young woman.
BORDEN
Sharp lad, your son.
YOUNG WOMAN
LAUGHS
My brother.
Borden smiles back.
