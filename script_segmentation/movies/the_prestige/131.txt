EXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY  DAY

Angier pushes his way through the dense undergrowth, trying
to keep up, but the cat has disappeared.
ANGIER
Here, kitty, kitty.
Suddenly, a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier. He begins
to follow the noise.
He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten
feet across.
Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier.
He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing
one. The other cat RACES off.
Angier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at
TOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks
its way through them.
The SECOND  cat jumps from Angier's hands RACES into
the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the
WOODS BEYOND
Angier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of
dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS.
