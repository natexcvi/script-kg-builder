INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE  DAY

A heavy, disinterested man slouches in the third row of the
empty theatre with a newspaper MERRIT, the stage manager.
Onstage, Angier energetically YANKS coloured handkerchiefs
from a hat and TOSSING them into the air. Olivia, in the
glamorous, revealing costume of Magician's Assistant, darts
back and forth PLUCKING the handkerchiefs from the air.
Angier finishes with a flourish. Merrit shrugs. Angier
places an ORNATE CAGE onto the table.
ANGIER
I need a volunteer.
Merrit rolls his eyes. Climbs to his feet. Angier produces
a DOVE. Places it in the cage.
