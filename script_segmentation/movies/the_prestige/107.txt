INT. STAGE  LATER

As Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too
small, something is LOWERED from the flies above
ANGIERROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain. A sign
around his neck reads OPENING AT PANTAGE THE PROFESSOR
Borden looks up behind him.
BORDEN
Great Danton, I must apologize! I
simply had too much magic for my
stage at the Pantages!
The Great Danton comes to rest three feet above the stage.
BORDEN CONT'D
Pardon my intrusion!
Borden places the top hat and ANGIERROOT at a JAUNTY 
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. Borden BOWS, hops down
off the stage, and walks up the aisle, bowing, enjoying it
all the way.
