INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE  EVENING

The bar is dark and seedy, packed with an unpromising lot.
ANGIER V.O.
...and his account suggests a reason.
Root is hanging precariously from his barstool, head lolling
towards his empty glass. He is in his own clothes, but
cleaned up to look like Angier.
A full PINT arrives in front of him. Root turns to face his
benefactor BORDEN. Root takes several large GULPS, staring
at Borden. Suppresses a belch.
ROOT
To what do I owe the pleasure of
this rather welcome pint of ale?
BORDEN
You are the Great Danton, aren't
you?
Root gestures silence, glancing around them.
ROOT
Of course I am. But don't advertise
it I will be mobbed with fans.
grins at Borden
And who might you be?
BORDEN
Just a humble admirer. And fellow
practitioner.
ROOT
Ah, very good.
Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass
in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK.
BORDEN
Another?
ROOT
If you insist. I am not perfoming
tonight. Well, only one show, and,
to be frank, my people pretty much
run things these days.
BORDEN
You could probably do it blindfolded.
ROOT
Bloody good idea.
BORDEN
Have it.
ROOT
Thanks.
A new pint arrives. Root sips.
BORDEN
Actually, there's something I might
warn you about.
ROOT
Oh?
BORDEN
Well, it's your Transported Man
illusion. Now, I am noit claiming to
know your method... but I had a
similar trick in my act and I used...
looks around,
WHISPERING
...a double.
ROOT
Oh, I see, very good.
BORDEN
At first. Then it went bad. You
se, I hadn't counted on the fact
that once I incorporated this bloke
into my act, he had complete power
over me.
ROOT
Complete power, you say?
BORDEN
NODDING GRAVELY
Weel, he was the secret, you see.
And the more successful I became,
the more outrageous his demands
became. He practically backrupted
me. In the end I had to stop
performing the illusion completely.
looks at Root
You must be very careful about giving
someone that power over you.
Root looks at Borden. Drunken whells spinning.
ROOT
Thanks for the warning.
