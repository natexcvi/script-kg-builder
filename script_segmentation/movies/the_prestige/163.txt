INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP  DAY

Angier steps forward as another curtain is drawn up behind
him, revealing TESLA'S MACHINE.
ANGIER
In my travels I have seen the future,
and it is a strange future indeed.
The world is on the brink of new and
terrifying possibilities.
The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and
BOLTS fly from it. SMOKE drift over the audience.
Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front
of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity
behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps
into the machine.
The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine
and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs.
Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost
impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but,
just before it does Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S
BODY FALLING THROUGH A TRAP DOOR.
The machine sputters out. Angier has DISAPPEARED. The lights
are dim. A FOLLOW SPOT FIRES into the BOXES, audience looks
up with a gathering commotion
ANGIER IS STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE ROYAL BOX, thirtyfeet
above stalls. He smiles down at the audience.
ANGIER CONT'D
Man's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION!
The audience breaks into a MASSIVE STANDING OVATION.
