the center barn is a 200ft steel TOWER capped with a GIANT
STEEL BALL. GIANT ARCING BOLTS of electricity run down the

through the fence.
He is sent FLYING backwards  the fence has been electrified.
The tower is SHUT OFF a door opens and a stout little MAN,
shotgun under one arm, MARCHES up to the fence. He uses a
RUBBER PAD to pry open the fence and stands over Angier, who
is CURLED on the ground, GROWNLING in pain, trying to stand.
