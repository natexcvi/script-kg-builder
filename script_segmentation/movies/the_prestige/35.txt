INT. BEDSIT  NIGHT

Julia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like
a robe, HOBBLING. He pulls up the sheeyt between his knees
is a goldfish bowl.
ANGIER
I can barely lift this thing and
it's not even filled with water. Or
fish. He must be strong as an ox.
JULIA
INCREDULOUS
He's been preteding to be an cripple
for years?
ANGIER
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.
Angier puts the bowl down with a flourish. Climbs into bed.
ANGIER CONT'D
Borden saw it at once. I couldn't
fathom it living your whole life
pretending to be someone else.
JULIA
You are pretending to be someone else.
ANGIER
I don't think changing your name
compares.
JULIA
Not just your name who you are,
where you are from...
ANGIER
I promised my family I wouldn't
embarrass them with my theatrical
endeavors.
Angier cuddles up to Julia.
JULIA
I came up with a name for you...
The Great Danton
ANGIER FROWNS
You don't like it? It's
sophisticated.
ANGIER
It's French.
