INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE  NIGHT

Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He
GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE
EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the
Stagehand's face. He is BLIND. Borden moves on.
