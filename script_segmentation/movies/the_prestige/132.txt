INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP  DAY

The top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the
table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier
and Alley are watching.
ANGIER
So the machine was working?
ALLEY
I never bothered to check the
calibration. The hat never moved.
TESLA
These things never quite work as you
expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's
one of the principal beauties of
science.
Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a
tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another
hat. It has the same TEAR.
TESLA CONT'D
We will need a couple of weeks to iron
OUT THE
looks at hats
problems with the machine. I will
send word when it's ready.
Angier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door.
TESLA CONT'D
Don't forget your hat.
Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
ANGIER
Which one is mine?
TESLA
They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.
Tesla smiles at him.
