The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.

Look closer.
BOY
It's got two heads.
Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave.
BORDEN
Never. Show. Anyone.
The Boy looks at him, a little afraid.
BORDEN CONT'D
They will beg you and flatter you for
the secret but as soon as you give
it up you will be nothing to them.
Understand? Nothing. The secret
impresses no one the trick you use
it for is everything.
Borden looks into the boy's staring eyes. Then SMILES and
pets him on the head. he stands. Sarah smiles at him.
BORDEN CONT'D

SARAH
