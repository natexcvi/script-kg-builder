INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP  DAY

Angier and Cutter at the workbench, examine a BIRD CAGE.
Cutter is wearing a strange LEATHER HARNESS over his shirt
it has LARGE SPRINGS and small PULLEYS on the back.
ANGIER
The bird cage can't be our climax
everybody knows it.

Not like this, they don't.
ANGIER

TER
SNAPS

glares at Angier
You are a magician, not a wizard you
have to get your hands dirty to
achieve the impossible.
ANGIER
You sound like him.
TER
holds up cage
Put your hands on the sides...
