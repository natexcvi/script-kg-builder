INT. PUB  DAY

Angier sits at the bar. Staring. He raises his pint glass.
Downs it, then STOPS, looking at the bottom there is a
PLAYING CARD. He loos around. Cutter is sitting at a table
with two fresh pints in front of him. Angier heads over.
ANGIER
Never thought I had find an answer at
the bottom of a pint glass.
TER
Hasn't stopped you looking.
ANGIER SITS
I heard about a booking. Nice little
theatre. Good upandcoming magician.
ANGIER
Who?
TER
You.
ANGIER
You got me a booking? Why?
Cutter looks down into his beer.
TER
Because I want to keep working...
looks up at Angier
And who's going to hire the ingeneur
who killed Julia McCullough in front
of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
Angier looks back at Cutter.
ANGIER
Someone who know that it wasn't your
fault. Someone who knows Alfred
Borden and his repertoire of exotic
knots.
TER
Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing
a bullet catch South of the river.
Angier looks down at the liquid in his glass.
ANGIER
To die like that. Locked in water...
lungs screaming...
SHAKES HEAD
What did she go through, Cutter?
Cutter watches Angier's distress.
TER
I knew an old sailor. Told me about
a time he got pulled over the side
tangled in the sheets... they dragged
him out, but it was five minutes
before he coughed...
Angier stares at Cutter. Hanging.
TER CONT'D
He said it was like... going home.
Angier considers this. Collects himself.
ANGIER
Which knot did Borden tie that night?
TER
He wouldn't say.
ANGIER
Wouldn't say?!
TER
It was as if... as if he didn't know.
