INT. BEDSIT  DAY

Sarah unlocks the door, but has to PUSH against MAGICAL PROPS
stacked against it the bedsit is FILLED with DEVICES.
SARAH
Alfred?!
Sarah surveys the confusion spots Borden across the flat
deep in conversation with another man. Borden spots her
BORDEN
We have our routine for Ackerman!
The other man turns it is Fallon.
SARAH
COLD
We haven't had the pleasure.
Fallon nods. Borden comes over, holding a DUELING PISTOL.
BORDEN
Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur
SARAH
Where did yo get all of
BORDEN
Begged, borrowed and don't ask.
Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
SARAH
I need talk to you.
Fallon slips past Sarah with a nod to Borden. Exits. Sarah
looks at Borden. TENSE.
SARAH CONT'D
We can't afford to pay him
BORDEN
We will start making money once we
have our audience
SARAH
And until then? What I earn is barely
enough for us.
BORDEN
SHRUGS
I will give him half of my food.
Sarah looks meaningfully at Borden.
SARAH
You are already going to be sharing
it with someone else.
Borden looks at her, confused. Then realizes.
BORDEN
You are...?
SARAH
Having a baby.
Borden freezes. Then SMILES, taking her in his arms. She
FLINCHES against the gun he is holding.
SARAH CONT'D
What's this?
BORDEN
The trick to wake up Ackerman at the
end of my audition.
SARAH
Your great trick? The masterpiece
that will make our fortunes?
BORDEN
No. The world isn't ready for that
one, yet.
Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun.
Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...
BORDEN CONT'D
This is merely a runofthemill
daring and spectacular bullet catch
Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...
SARAH
I am not letting you get shot.
Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD
and hands the pistol to Sarah.
BORDEN
It's perfectly safe. Shoot me.
Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at
Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him.
BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to catch the bullet. The
mirror is intact.
Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in
his hand.
SARAH
Show me.
Borden shakes head
Then you are not doing it. I can't
raise a child on my own, Alfred.
Borden looks at her. Takes the bullet from her and places
it on the bureau.
BORDEN
The bullet goes in the gun. Then
comes the ramrod.
He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which
disappears.
BORDEN CONT'D
AND VOILS
He points the ramrod at Sarah she pulls the bullet out of
the HOLLOW TIP.
BORDEN CONT'D
The buller's not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.
Sarah looks at ramrod with disdain.
SARAH
Once you know it's so obvious.
Borden BRISTLES slightly. Takes the bullet back.
BORDEN
Yes, well, people still get killed
perfoming it.
SARAH
How?
BORDEN
Sme smartarse drops something down
the barrel.
SARAH
Such as?
BORDEN
A penny, or a button. Or, of course,
a bullet.
off worried look
But don't fret
Borden embraces her, putting his hand on her belly.
BORDEN CONT'D
I am not letting anything happen I
love you too much.
Sarah grabs his face, looking at his eyes, smiling.
SARAH
Say it again.
BORDEN
I love you.
SARAH
MATTEROFFACT
Nope. Not today.
BORDEN
What?
SARAH
SMILES
Some days, it's not true. Todayt
you don't mean it. Maybe today you are
more in love with magic than me.
OFF LOOK
It's alright. I like being able to
tell the difference it makes the
days it is true mean something.
Borden shakes his head, grinning.
