INT. STAIRWELL  EVENING

Sarah lingers at the top of the stairs to her flat. Borden
tries to KISS her, but she pushes him back. He tests the
LOCK of the open door.
BORDEN
Enough to keep me out?
SARAH
I think so. Wil I see you again?
Borden SHRUGS and turns to go back down the stairs. Sarah
looks after him, about to change her min. Hesitates.
