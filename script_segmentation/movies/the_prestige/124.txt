Borden turns to see Fallon show in Olivia.
BORDEN V.O.
His assistent come to us with a
proposition...
They start to speak as Borden's V.O. continues.
BORDEN V.O. CONT'D
Obviously Angier has sent her, and
told her to admit as much...
BORDEN CONT'D
Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking
his bows under the stage?
Olivia meets his gaze.
OLIVIA
No. It's killing him. He's obssessed
with discovering your method. he
thinks of nothing else, and takes no
pleasure in our success. I have had
enough. There is no future with
him. He sent me here to steal your
secrets, but I have actually come to
offer you his.
BORDEN
He has no secrets from me.
Borden stares at her, unsure.
BORDEN CONT'D
This is the truth you spoke of?
She gives him a sly smile.
OLIVIA
No. This is what he told me to tell
you.

OLIVIA CONT'D

They sit there in silence, appraising each other.
BORDEN

possibly have to offer me?
Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand.
Borden flinches, surprised.
OLIVIA

She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his

I am sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand.
BORDEN
QUIETLY
It does.
OLIVIA
Then let people know. You can be so

Borden looks into her eyes.
BORDEN V.O.
I think she is telling the truth.
