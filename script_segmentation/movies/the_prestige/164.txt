EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE  NIGHT

Fallon is at the workbench, staring at a sketch of Tesla's
machine. Borden paces, AGITATED.
BORDEN
Why only 100 performances? Do his
methods dictate it, or is it simply
a publicity move?
Borden walks back and stares at the sketch.
BORDEN CONT'D
Fifty yards in a second. And all I
know is that he uses a trapdoor.
What's going on under that stage?
