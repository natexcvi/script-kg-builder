EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY  CONTINUOUS

Alley opens the door Angier BURSTS IN past him, ENRAGED.
ANGIER
I have veen played for a fool!
ALLEY
Who by?
ANGIER
Tesla never made a machine like the
one I asked for.
ALLEY
We never said he had.
ANGIER
You let me believe that he had, Alley!

ANGIER CONT'D
You stole my money because your
funding was cut off you have been
shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along while you
use my money to stave off ruin.
I have seen Edison's men
ALLEY
Where?
ANGIER
In the hotel. I have every mind to
bring them up here myself
TESLA
That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
Tesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT.
TESLA CONT'D
It is true, sir, that you are your
one remaining financier. But we
have not stolen your money...
ALLEY
Sir, my cat?
Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE.
ALLEY CONT'D
When I told you I could make your
machine I spoke the simple truth.
Science is just a name for the art
of rendering the exotic mundane. It
has no boundaries its very purpose
is to destroy boundaries.
ANGIER
Then why isn't the machine working?
Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles.
TESLA
Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is
not an exact science. The machine
simply does not operate as expected.
It needs continued examination.
ANGIER
Where did my top hat go?
ALLEY
Nowhere.
Alley points to the top hat, which is sitting on a workbench.
ALLEY CONT'D
We have tried the damn thing a dozen
times. And the hat went nowhere.
TESLA
Which is why we need to rey a
different material. It may provoke
a different result.
Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
TESLA CONT'D
You don't expect me to handle the
thing myself?
Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the
TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the
animal bu its collar to a eyehook sunk into the ground.
ALLEY
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, Doctor.
Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the
generator.
The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES.
Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large
BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the
unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then
sputters out.
Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit.
Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there,
still tied to the hook.
Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car.
Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of
Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab.
ANGIER
I will go.
Angier limps after the cat.
