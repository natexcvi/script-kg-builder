INT. ANGIER'S ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN  EVENING

Angier rounds the bend in the road and comes into view of
the laboratory. He FREEZES.
The fence has been TORN DOWN. Beyond it, the LAB has been
BURNED TO THE GROUND. The metal tower is in SMOLDERING
PIECES. Everything else is gone.
Angier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him,
and, using his cane, flips it over. It's Alley's sign warning
trespassers to keep out.
