INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE  NIGHT

Angier, almost unrecognizanle as a blonde, slips into the
back of the theatre, which is as rough and unwelcoming as
Borden's last venue.
On the small raised stage, Borden works through his way
through the Chinese rings with GLOVED HANDS to hide his
damaged fingers. The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM.
Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag.
BORDEN
I need a volunteer.
Angier takes a few steps towards the stage.
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL.
he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
BORDEN CONT'D
As you can see , it's just a rubber
ball. But it's not normal at all.
Angier examines the ball. Hands it back to Borden who shows
no sign of recognizing Angier.
BORDEN CONT'D
Thank you.
Angier notices that two TALL  CABINETS are standing
twenty feet apart on the stage.
BORDEN CONT'D
TO AUDIENCE
You are not impressed?
Borden BOUNCES the BALL on the ground and catches it.
BORDEN CONT'D
It's a magic ball.
Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor. The
audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.
OLIVIA V.O.
