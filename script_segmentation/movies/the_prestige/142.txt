EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY  NIGHT  FLASHBACK

Angier steps into the massive, elegant room.
Standing on the dance floor is an ENORMOUS SHIPPING CRATE.
Stencilled on one side COLORADO SPRINGS
Angier walks up to the huge crate, awestruck.
An envelope addressed to him has been stuck to the front.
Angier stops it and begins to read.
TESLA V.O.
My dear Angier, you will find what
you were looking for in the box. I
apologize for leaving without saying
goodbye...
