EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY  CONTINUOUS

The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical
DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower.
Angier stops, fearful.
ALLEY
It's perfectly safe.
As Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center
of the CONFLAGRATION.
Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE,
towards Angier.
TESLA
So this is the Great Danton.
Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he
were on his way to the opera. He brushes SPARKS from the
sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier.
TESLA CONT'D
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.
Something you did with pockets?
Angier returns the handshake.
ANGIER
I saw a lecture you gave in London,
several years ago. I am flattered
you agreed to see me.
Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.
Angier, confused, does so. Alley hands him a lightbulb,
which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base.
ANGIER CONT'D
What's conducting the electricity?
TESLA
Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite
capable of conducting, and indeed,
producing energy.
Tesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out. Alley takes
it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands.
TESLA CONT'D
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
