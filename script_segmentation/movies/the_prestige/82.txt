INT. GREEN ROOM DRINKING CLUB  EVENING

The club is warm and dark. Olivia, Cutter and Angier make
their way to the bar. Olivia points to the far end of the
bar, to a TRAMP in tattered clothing, curled over a pint.

little joke?
Angier smiles unconfortably. Sunddely Root WRAPS this hands
around Angier's neck and begins to THROTTLE him.
Cutter breaks it up and pushes Root back.

Angier is shaken. Root picks up his hat off the bar and
disappears onto the street.
