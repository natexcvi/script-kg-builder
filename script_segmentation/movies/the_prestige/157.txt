EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE  DAY

Cutter makes his way past the tattered box office and into
the derelivt auditorium.
In the middle of the room is the CRATE. Cutter stands and
stares at it.
MALE VOICE O.S.
WHO'S THERE
Cutter turns. A STAGEHAND. His eyes are solid white. The
man is clearly BLIND.
TER
I I am looking for an old friend
ANGIER O.S.
I heard about a booking...
Cutter turns. Angier is behind him, leaning on his cane.
Beside Angier is a SECOND BLIND STAGEHAND.
ANGIER CONT'D
Nice little theatre. Good upand
coming magician.
TER
You came back.
ANGIER
It's a good to see you, John.
Cutter sizes Angier up. Looks around the theatre.
TER
Good rehearsal space. Blind
stagehands. I like it
KNOWING SMILE
You always had an eye for publicity.
Angier sits in one of the stalls. Cutter follows suit.
ANGIER
I need your help, John. My last
show. A limited engagement.
TER
Your last show?
ANGIER
A wise man once told me that obsession
was a young man's game. I am almost
done. One thing left...
points at crate
The real Transported Man.
Cutter stares at the crate.
TER
You want to design a show around it?
ANGIER
i don't want you backstage, I need
you front of house, managing.
Cutter considers this. Uncertain.
ANGIER CONT'D
i need you calling in any favours
and connections you have left to get
us the right booking for the run.
TER
What sort of booking are you after?
ANGIER
The sort that Borden can't ignore.
Cutter looks at Angier. Nods.
