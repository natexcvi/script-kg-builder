INT. COURTROOM  DAY

Cutter sits in the CROWDED GALLERY. Borden, in the dock,
SCANS the crowd. Finally SPOTS Fallon pushing to the front
he is alone. Borden stares at him. Fallon shakes his dead.
Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters.
The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig.
JUDGE
Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.
You will, in one month's time, be
hanged by the neck until dead. May
the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Borden barely reacts.
