EXT. HIGHGATE CEMETARY  MORNING

Fallon drops heavily into an almostvertical OPEN COFFIN.
DISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses TER DROP THE LID INTO
PLACE, shutting him in. Cutter starts NAILING it down.
A GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box. Cutter falls
back, but is caught by Angier.
Angier rolls Cutter off to one side. He is clutching at a
BLOODY WOUND on his arm.
TER
I will live.
TO COFFIN
You save me the trouble to making
you an air hole!
Angie picks up the hammer and continues NAILING.
