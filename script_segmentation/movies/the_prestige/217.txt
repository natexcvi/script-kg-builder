INT. ABANDONED THEATRE  NIGHT

Cutter WHIPS the shawl away cage and bird have disappeared.
TER V.O.
But you wouldn't clap yet.
Jess stares, EXPECTANT. Cutter hols up his handkerchief
covered hand...
TER V.O. CONT'D
Because making something disappear
isn't enough...
Cutter whips the handkerchief from his hand, revealing a
canary. Just then, Jess SEES something and JUMPS off the
chest, running past him...
TER V.O. CONT'D
You have to bring it back.
BORDEN IS IN THE DOORWAY JESS LEAPS INTO HIS ARMS. Borden
holds her tight. Looks at Cutter, who is putting on his
coat. Nods. Cutter leaves.
Borden reaches into his pocket and hand Jess his rubber ball.
She smiles, then buries her head in his neck.
