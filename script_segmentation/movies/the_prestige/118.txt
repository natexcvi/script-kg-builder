INT. HOSPITAL  EVENING

Borden picks up his way through the overgrown cemetary. He
hears a KNOCKING and turns
Angier is behind him, RAPPING on a broken headstone with the
head of his cane.
BORDEN
I am impressed.
ANGIER
Why's that?
BORDEN
You are finally getting your hands
dirty. This is what a good trick
costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
ANGIER
The sacrifice, I am afraid, is all
going to be yours. Unless you give
me what I want.
BORDEN
Which is?
ANGIER
Your secret.
Borden tries to gauge Angier's expression.
BORDEN
My secret?
ANGIER
Your method for the Transported Man.
Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact,
he doesn't talk at all.
BORDEN
SHRUGS
You have my notebook.
ANGIER
Useless without the keyword.
Angier pulls a sheaf of writing paper and a pencil stub from
his pocket. He offers them to Borden.
ANGIER CONT'D
Write down your method Mr. Borden.
Describe it in full.
Borden takes the paper and pencil and stares Angier in the
eye, gauging him.
Beat.
Borden writes a SINGLE WORD on the top page and folds it up.
ANGIER CONT'D
I want the method not the keyword I
don't even know if the secret is in
you notebook.
Borden looks at Angier with a glint in his eye.
BORDEN
The keyword is the method.
Angier reaches for the folded paper, which Borden lifts out
of reach.
BORDEN CONT'D
Where is my ingeneur?
Angier pulls a SHOVEL free from a pile of dirt beside him.
He STAKES it into a fresh pile of dirt in front of Borden.
Borden looks at Angier, CONCERNED.
BORDEN CONT'D
IS HE
Angier plucks the folded paper from Borden's hand.
ANGIER
How fast can you gid?
Angier movies away through the headstone, leaning heavily on
his cane. Borden begins to DIG.
