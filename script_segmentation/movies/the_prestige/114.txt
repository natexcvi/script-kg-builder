EXT. ALLEY  CONTINUOUS

Fallon continues to follow Borden at a distance. Borden
steps into a tobacconist's. Fallon stops and idles at the
street corner.
As Fallon watches, acrooss the street, another man STOPS.
Fallon slips back around the corner and looks
It's Angier, leaning on his cane.
Borden emerges from the tobacconist and continues down the
street, a cloud of pipe smoke drifting after him.
Fallon waits for Angier to set off after Borden, then follows
both men from a distance.
Borden crosses to the same side of the street as Angier.
Fallon picks up his pace and tries to cross the street but
is HELD UP for a second by passing traffi.
As he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees
Angier dissappear down and alleyway.
