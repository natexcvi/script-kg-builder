Borden smiles as he reads Angier's dairy.

How can be not know?!
STARTS LAUHING
Because, Angier, life is complicated,
people are complicated, knots are

Shit it, Professor, or I will shut it

Borden quiets. Looking at the journal.
BORDEN V.O.
How could I not know? How can you
read my story and not understand?
