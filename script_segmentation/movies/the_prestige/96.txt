INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE  NIGHT

DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN ACCEPT NO CHEAP
IMITATIONS!!!
ANGIER CONT'D
He will be perfoming right across the
street.
TER
We have a bigger problem. Root.
ANGIER
Don't tell me he fell over again.
TER
Worse. He realized he can make
demands.
ANGIER
He's blackmailing us?
TER
In a word, yes. I am surprised, to
be honest it usually takes them a
lot longer to figure it out.
ANGIER
How much does he want?
TER
It makes no difference we have to
stop doing the trick.
ANGIER
WIELDS PAPER
Stop doing the trick? Look at this.
TER
Look at yesterday's. And last week's,
where they called you London's
premiere stage performer, not
magician mind. Performer. Of any
kind.
ANGIER
What's the point?
TER
My point, Robert, is that you have
climbed too high to get away with
any kind of professional
embarrassament. We are not doing any
tricks we can't control.
Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking.
ANGIER
Pay him whatever he wants, for now.
We keep doing the trick till Borden
opens, then we will phase it out.
