INT. WORKSHOP  DAY  FLASHBACK

A drowing tank, identical to the one we have already seen.
A blind stagehand sits behind it, smoking.
ANGIER V.O.
Not knowing if I had be the Prestige....
Suddenly, a trap door flashes open as Angier falls from the
stage door and SPLASHES into the tank. The lid snaps shut.
ANGIER V.O. CONT'D
Or the man in the box...
Angier pounds on the glass, frantic. The blind stagehand
continues smoking. Oblivious.
