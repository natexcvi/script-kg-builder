BORDEN V.O.
Two young man devoted to an
illusion...
Two rows in front sits Angier. Similarly youthful.
BORDEN V.O. CONT'D
Two young men who never intended to
hurt anyone.
Onstage is a TANK. Standing beside the tank is a beautiful
young magician's assistant. JULIA.
The magician, MILTOn, adress the audience.
MILTON
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman...
Milton GESTURES to Julia the MEN in the crowd go wild hands
in the air, catcalls. Smiling radiantly, Julia selects two
young men, who SCRAMBLE up to the stage ANGIER and BORDEN
younger, full of energy Angier has no limp.
They spring onto stage, beside Julia and take the ROPE she
offers them. Milton GRABS a HOOK that descends from the
flies on a chain.
Cutter is watching fron the wings.
MILTON CONT'D
Are either of you two gentlemen
gailors?
Both shakes their hands as they start to bind Julia with the
ropes, Borden wrapping the rope around her wrists, Angier
the one around her ankles.
MILTON CONT'D
Well, I am sure you can both tie a
strong knot...
As Borden finishes his knot tests it, it SLIPS APART.
Borden frowns, hastly RETYING it, covering.
Cutter NOTICES.
Borden finishes, glancing at julia who gives a small sign of
assent with her eyes. As Angier finishes tying her ankles
he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle. She frowns at him and
raises her arms. Milton hooks the rope onto the chain.
Milton gesticulates in the wings, Cutter signals to a
stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air.
Milton wheels the tank under Julia's bare feet. Cutter feels
for the handle of an AXE placed by his feet and pulls out a
STOP.
JULIA looks down at Angier. They smile at each other. Julia
DROPS into the tank with a massive splash Milton SLAMS the
lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank...
Cutter checks his stopwatch, grips the handle of the axe...
A grand GESTURE from Milton the curtain around the tank
DROPS Julia is GONE. Milton raises the curtain again, then
with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the
tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling.
The audience erupts in APPLAUSE. Angier smiles produly.
