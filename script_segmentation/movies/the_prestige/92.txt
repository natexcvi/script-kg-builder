INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY  DAY

Alley shows Angier in. Tesla is sitting, reading.
TESLA
You must be curious to see what so
much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
Tesla RISES. Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
pulls a SHEET from a tenfoot tall apparatus the ELECTRICAL
MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film.
TESLA CONT'D
Fitting that you should be here for
the maiden voyage.
Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the
machine. It RUMBLES into life, smoke pouring from the slats.
TESLA CONT'D
Your hat.
Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla.
Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
directly underneath the machine. He returns to the controls.
ALLEY
You might want to stand back.
TESLA
No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley,
please proceed.
Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine.
Nothing happens. Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of
the tripped FLASHES whits hot. BOLTS shooting out of it,
wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod. The CHARGE
reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has
broken the sound barrier.
Suddenly the room is still.
Tesla walks forward. Looks down into the pit.
Alley joins him at the edge of the pit. Angier, limping,
is the last to arrive, locking into the pit
at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.
ANGIER
I don't understand
Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with
CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit.
ALLEY
Perhaps it would be best if you left
us to it. We will see you next week?
Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door.
