INT. WORKSHOP  DAY

Angier stops trying tomove and leans back, resigned.
BORDEN
SCORN
You went halfway around the world.
You spent a fortune. You did terrible
things... and all of it for nothing.
Angier looks up at him with his last spark of competitiveness.
ANGIER
Nothing? You never understood, id
you? Why we did this?
COUGHS
The audience knows the truth that
the world is simple. Miserable.
Solid all the way through. But if
you could fool them, even for a
second, you could make them wonder.
Then you got to see something very
special...
coughs, looks up
You really don't know?
Borden just stares at Angier. Who smiles.
ANGIER CONT'D
It was the look on their faced.
Angier's body TOPPLES over, KNOCKING over the lantern. Borden
steps back as the oil spreads, flamming, fro the lantern.
TER V.O.
Every magic trick consists of three
parts, or acts...
Borden watches Angier for a moment, then turns to leave.
