EXT. NORTH HILL  DAY

Borden escorts Sarah and their TODDLER, a girl, up the three
lined street.
Borden stops abruptly. Crouches to his daugther.
BORDEN
Would you like to see a magic trick?
Borden reaches up and pushes a wayward LOCK a her hair over
her ear. When his hands returns, it's holding a KEY.
He stands, places the key in Sarah's hand.
SARAH
What is this for?
Borden takes her gently by the shoulders and turns her around
until she's facing a modest twostory HOUSE. She looks down
at the key in her hand.
SARAH CONT'D
When I asked last week you said we
couldn't afford.
BORDEN
You caught me in the wrong mood.
SARAH
But you want through all the
BORDEN
Sarah, I am allowed to change my
mind, aren't I? The act is taking
off, maybe soon I will get us into a
bigger theatre. Things will work.
Sarah turns and embraces her husband.
