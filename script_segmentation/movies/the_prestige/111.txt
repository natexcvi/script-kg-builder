INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP  DAY

Olivia enters in to the darkness bedroom. She strikes a
match and lights one of the gaslights...
...and SCREAMS as the gaslight illuminates Angier, sitting
in an armchair, cane leaning against the arm of the chair.
ANGIER
You weren't expecting me?
OLIVIA
I was expecting you sooner, Robbie.
Your message said afternoon.
ANGIER
Well, it takes a bit for me to get
around these days...
Angier RAPS his leg brace with his cane. HOISTS himself up.
ANGIER CONT'D
He's taken everything from me. My
wife, my career... now you.
OLIVIA
What do you mean? You sent me to
Angier takes her by the shoulders, ROUGHLY.
ANGIER
I sent you to steal his secret not
to improve his act
OLIVIA
That's my job!
ANGIER
Or to fall in love with him!
OLIVIA
You abandoned me to him!
Angier SLAPS her. She shakes her head at him.
OLIVIA CONT'D
I did everything you asked.
ANGIER
CHALLENGING
Yes? Then how does he do it?!
OLIVIA
Cutter was right it's a double.
Angier shakes his head, furious.
ANGIER
Of course Borden said that
OLIVIA
He didn't say anything he had never
say. I have seen things makeup,
glasses, wigs. We don't use any of
it for the show, but I have found it
hidden backstage.
ANGIER
SCORN
It's misdirection he leaves those
things lying around to make you think
he's using a double.
OLIVIA
All the time? He doesn't know when
I'M LOOKING
ANGIER
All the time, Olivia that's who he
is, that's what it takes he lives
his act, don't you see?!
And just because you are sleeping
with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
Olivia glares athim, tears forming in her eyes.
OLIVIA
You thing you can see everything,
don't you?
She moves to her bed, REACHING below the mattress.
OLIVIA CONT'D
But the Great Danton, is a blind
fool.
Olivia tosses something at Angier a CARDBOARDBOUND NOTEBOOK.
OLIVIA CONT'D
His notebook.
Angier starts leafing desperately through pages.
ANGIER
You stole it?
OLIVIA
I borrowed it for tonight. I thought
you had be able to translate some of
it, but now I realize
ANGIER
I can't.
OLIVIA
SCORN
You can't.
ANGIER
Olivia, no one could
STUDIES PAGES
It's a cypher with a transposition
that probably shifts every day of
the diary. Even with the keyword it
would take months to decode...
OLIVIA
And without the keyword?
ANGIER
Perhaps never. We will see.
Angier puts the cardboardbound notebook into his pocket.
Olivia, worried, holds out her hand for the notebook.
OLIVIA
No, we won't if I don't get that
back tomorrow morning, he will know I
took it.
Angier looks at her, incredulous.
ANGIER
You can'r possibly think I had let
this go? This is his diary, Olivia.
All of his secrets are right here,
in my hands.
OLIVIA
PLEADING
Don't do this do me, Robert!
ANGIER
SHRUGS
Leave him.
OLIVIA
He knows where I live!
ANGIER
I need to know his method.
OLIVIA
DESPERATE
It won't get your wife back, Robert.
ANGIER
I don't care about my wife I care
about his secret!
Angier stops, realizing what he said. Calms himself.
ANGIER CONT'D
Look, I will go to his workshop and
stage a breakin
OLIVIA
He will know it was you
Angier puts his hands GENTLY on her shoulders.
ANGIER
Yes, me, not you. Understand?
Olivia nods, crying. Still scared. Angier drags his leg to
the door. She watches him go, torn.
OLIVIA
Robert? I have fallen in love with
him.
Angier looks at her, sympathetic.
ANGIER
Then I know how hard this had been
hard for you.
