INT. WORKSHOP  LATER

Borden gently strokes the bird's feathered head.
BORDEN
You are the lucky one tonight.
Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages  each one
with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage
and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the
TABLE a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE.
Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart.
A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below.
Borden SLAPS the cage.
And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out
and SPLASHES into the bucket.
