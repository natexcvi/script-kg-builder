INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP  NIGHT

A NEWSPAPER on the makeup table. Angier sits at the mirror.
He hubs BROWN PASTE into his hair and then combs it out.
Then he chooses a beard, seats it on his chin and begins to
adjust it. He drops the BOTTLE of spirit gum as he looks in
the mirror and sees OLIVIA standing behind him.
ANGIER
EMBARRASSED
I thought you had gone.
Olivia shifts. Embarrassed.
OLIVIA
I don't really.... have anywhere to
go.
Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
ANGIER
You have been sleeping here?
OLIVIA
Cutter said it would be okay till we
get another booking.
What are you doing?
ANGIER
Researching. Part of a magician's
job is to watch his competition, to
see what illusions they are
OLIVIA
You are going to do something to that
man, aren't you?
Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet.
OLIVIA CONT'D
Cutter's hopig you will let things
life. He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you then we can
ANGIER
Even? My wife for a couple of his
fingers? He has a child now. And
he's perfoming again.
BITTER
Borden is out there, living his life
just as he always intended. As if
nothing had happened. And look at
me. I am alone. And no theatre will
touch me.
OLIVIA
Us.
Olivia moves towards him.
OLIVIA CONT'D
You are going to need a better
disguise.
Olivia reaches for Angier's beard.
