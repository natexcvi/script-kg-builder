EXT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE  EVENING

Borden, clutching an envelope, is escorted across the yard,
PEERING at the fence. He catches a glimpse of this daughter
waling beside a man on the wooden section.
As Borden reaches the fence he CROUCHES to greet his little
girl, forcing the Sullen and the other Warder to crouch to
undo his chains.
BORDEN
Jess, how are you?
Jess SMILES at him and reaches through the fence.
BORDEN CONT'D
Are you alright?
She nods.
BORDEN CONT'D
I have missed you. Fallon's missed
you. We both have.
Borden drinks in her gace, her hair. She grasps the fence.
JESS
Can I come in there, Daddy?
BORDEN
Everything's going to be okay.
It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER.
He rises to come facetoface with Lord Caldlow
BORDEN CONT'D
You must be Lord
who is ROBERT ANGIER. Risen from the dead.
ANGIER
ENGLISH ACCENT
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have
been.
Borden STARES at Angier.
BORDEN
I saw you die.
Angier just SMILES.
ANGIER
They flatter you with all those
chains, Alfred. Don't they know you
can't escape without your little
rubber ball?
Borden says nothing.
ANGIER CONT'D
All I wanted to do was prove that I

You were always afraid to get your
hands dirty...

ANGIER

box, the man who disappears.
BORDEN
You win. But don't take my little
girl...
Angier looks at Borden. Bitter
ANGIER
I know how hard it is to have someone
so precious taken away, don't I

ANGIER CONT'D
Borden? But you can't take her with
you know, can you? She will be looked
after. Goodbye, Professor.
Angier gently pulls Jess back from the fence. She PROTESTS
Desperate, Borden holds out the envelope.
BORDEN
Wait. Don't you want this? You
paid for it.
ANGIER
Your secret.
Borden nods. Angier steps up, takes the envelope.
ANGIER CONT'D
You always were the better magician,
Borden. We both know that.
HE TEARS the envelope in half. Then again. And again...
ANGIER CONT'D
But whatever your secret was, you will
have to agree
He tosses the peices on the ground.
ANGIER CONT'D
VICTORIOUS
mine is better.
Angier TURNS.
BORDEN
Angier! Let me say goodbye. Please.
Angier stops. Lets Jess come to fence. She is crying.
JESS
When are you taking me home, Daddy?
BORDEN
Soon. I promise. Soon.
ANGIER
For God's sake, Borden.
BORDEN
Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.
HERE
Borden PRODUCES his RUBBER BALL. Jess looks at it.
BORDEN CONT'D
I promise.
Borden VANISHES the rubber ball. ANgier pulls Jess back
from the fence and starts walking away. Borden rises.
BORDEN CONT'D
You think this place can hold me,
Angier?
Angier continues walking Jess away. Shaking this head.
BORDEN CONT'D
Angier!
Borden is alone. He watches as the wind scatters the pieces
of his prestige over the muddy yard.
