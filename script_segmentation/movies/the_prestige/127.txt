INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY  DAY

Angier looks up from Borden's diary. Pale. He flips pages
and pages forward TO THE LAST ENTRY...
BORDEN V.O.
Today my mistress proves her
truthfulness. Not to me, you
understand.
BORDEN V.O. CONT'D
I have been convinced since she led
me to Root... today, Olivia proves
her love for me to you, Angier.
Angier looks up from the notebook. Mind reeling.
BORDEN V.O. CONT'D
Yes, Angier. She gave you this
noteboook at my request. Yes, she
led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is
merely the key to my dairy, not to
my trick. Did you really think I
would part with my secret so easily
after so much? Goodbye, Angier,
may you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in yout American home.
Angier STARES at the pages, unblinking. JUMPS to his feet...
