INT. RESTAURANT  EVENING

Merrit sits eating a sandwich. The door to his office opens
and ACKERMAN strides in. Merrit STRUGGLES to his feet.
MERRIT
SURPRISED
Mr. Ackerman. When they said...I
didn't think you had be here in person.
Ackerman sits without being asked to.
ACKERMAN
I have an act for your venue.
MERRIT
FLUSTERED
Well, of course, sir...But I am afraid
I am booked. The Moscow Ballet.
They are playing through next year.
ACKERMAN
Get rid of them. This is a magical
act. An excellent one. I believe
you booked his first engagement
several years ago. The Great Danton.
MERRIT
You really want me to
Ackerman stands.
MERRIT CONT'D
I will do it. Of course.
Ackerman picks up a pen and paper from Merrit's desk.
ACKERMAN
SMILES
There will be one hundred
performances. No more, no less.
Five perfomances a week. No
matinees, no weekends.
Ackerman scribbles onto the paper and hands it to Merrit.
ACKERMAN CONT'D
SMILES
And that's what you will be charging
for each ticket. Good day.
Ackerman sweeps out of the room, leaving Merrit dumbfounded,
staring at the scrap of paper in his hands.
