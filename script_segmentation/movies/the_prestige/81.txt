EXT. DECK, LABORATORY  MORNING

Angier, Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl
overlooking a spectacular view. They are eating sandwiches.
TESLA
Alley has explained that you require
a very interesting device.
ANGIER
I need something impossible.
TESLA
You are familiar with a phrase 'Man's
reach exceeds his grasp'?

TESLA CONT'D
off his look
It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his
nerve. The only limits on scientific
progress are these imposed by society.
Tesla looks out at the mountains.
TESLA CONT'D
The first time I changed the world I
was hailed as a visionary. The second
time I was asked politely to retire.
The world only tolerates one change
at a time. And so here I am.
gestures at laboratory
Enjoying retirement.
looking at Angier
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.
Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table.
TESLA CONT'D
Alley says you are a stage magician.
If a built you this device, you would
be presenting it only as an illusion?
ANGIER
If people thought the things I did
on stage were real, they wouldn't
clap they had scream. Think of saving
a woman in half.
Tesla nods. Considering.
TESLA
Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine
ANGIER
Price is not an object.
TESLA
Perhaps not. But have you considered
the cost?
ANGIER
I am noit sure I follow.
TESLA
I can make your machine, Mr. Angier.
But I can also give you some advice...
POINTED
Go home. Forget this thing. I can
recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley
could tell you, I myself an given to
one now and then. It will not do
you any good.
ANGIER
Have your obsessions done you no
good?
TESLA
At first. But I have followed them
too long I am their slave. Their
whipping boy. And one day they may
choose to destroy me.
Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
ANGIER
if you understand an obsession then
you know you won't change my mind.
TESLA
SMILES
So be it.
ANGIER
Will you build it?
TESLA
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the
mountain air. This will take time.
Tesla disappears into the lab.
