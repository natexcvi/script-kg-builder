INT. THEATRE  EVENING

Angier is perfoming to a good crowd. He steps forward.
ANGIER
You sir, in the hat. Could you show
us your handkerchief?
A MAN in the audience STANDS and pulls a HANDKERCHIEF from
his pocket. He stares at it, CONFUSED. The audience LAUGHS.
MAN
This isn't mine.
ANGIER
Perhaps you had be so good as to return
it to the other man. He has yours.
Another man stands and pulls out a handkerchief. APPLAUSE.
Angier dows and walks quickly off the stage, past the squad
of DANCING GIRLS who run on to entertain in the break.
