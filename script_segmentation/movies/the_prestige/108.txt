EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE  NIGHT

Cutter crouches over Angier, fixing a LONG SPLINT to his
broken leg. Behind them, Root still hangs above the stage,
groaning in protest.
TER
I don't see how Borden found him I
had him under wraps, I was careful.
ANGIER
Well, he did.
Cutter helps Angier to his feet.
TER
Sit, do you think it might be her?
Olivia?
Angier stops to look at Cutter.
ANGIER
No. I don't.
Cutter gestures at Root.
TER
Shall we cut him down?
ANGIER
He's the Great Danton. Let him cut
himself down.
