Both Bordens are standing at the workbench. One brother is
gripping the other by his wrist and placing a CHISEL on his
finger.
He checks the placemen of the chisel against his own mutilated
fingers, adjust the chisel's position, them picks up the
hammer.

Nothing easy about two men sharing
one life.
The second brother SWIGS from a gin bottle, then BITES down
a padded stick as the first brother BRINGS DOWN THE HAMMER
