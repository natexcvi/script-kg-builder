INT. BORDEN'S HOUSE  NIGHT

BORDEN stands at the fence again.
OWENS
Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that
you had reconsidered his offer.
BORDEN
Angier's journal, the gesture of
good faith? It's a fake.
OWENS
SURPRISED
I assure you it's not.
BORDEN
It has to be it refers to events
that happened after his death.
OWENS
Clever predictions, I am sure. The
provenance of the journal is clear
and under no doubt. It's written in
Angier own hand, of which we have
numerous examples.
looks at Borden
What makes you think it's a fake?
Borden looks away, uncomfortable.
BORDEN
It doesn't matter.
Borden leans forward and stuffs ROLLED PAPERS through the
fence. Owens takes them carefully.
BORDEN CONT'D
My tricks. All of them.
OWENS
Including the Transported Man? Lord
Caldlow will be very pleased.
BORDEN
No he won't. They are not complete
you only have the Pledge and Turn
for each.
Owens leafs through the papers, annoyed.
OWENS
Without the Prestige for each trick
these are wothless.
BORDEN
You will get the rest after you bring
my daughter here.
Owens looks at Borden.
BORDEN CONT'D
I want to say goodbye.
