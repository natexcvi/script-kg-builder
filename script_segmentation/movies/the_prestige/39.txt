POLICEMAN
POINTING
It's all laid out down the end, you
honour.
The Judge NODS. The Policeman exits, LOCKING them inside.
The Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical
apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE. Cutter looks up at it
with AWE, touching the side where it says COLORADO SPRINGS.
JUDGE
What's in there?
Cutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within.
TER
Angier's machine.
JUDGE
You built this, Mr.Cutter?
TER
SHAKES HEAD
Oh no. This wasn't built by a
magician... it was built by a wizard.
OFF LOOK
A man who can actually do the things
a magician pretends to...
Cutter closes the crats. The JUDGE turns to other props.
TER CONT'D

these things when the trial is over?
The Judge is staring at a large glass tank.
JUDGE
They have benn sold to a Lord Caldlo.
An avid collector, apparently very
interested in the case.
TER
Don't let him take this.
The Judge looks over. Cutter is touching the crate.
JUDGE
Why ever not?
TER
It's dangerous.
JUDGE
I am sure beneath its bells and
whistles it's get some simple and
disappointing trick.
TER
The most disappointing of all it
has no trick. It's real.
The Judge looks at Cutter. Smiles indulgently. Turns.
JUDGE
This is the tank Angier drowned in?
Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank.
Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is
a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid
TER
This lets the performer's hands reach
the trick padlock...
a small section POPS open.
JUDGE
A standard magical apparatus for
escapes?
TER
With one important difference...
Cutter grabs the PADLOCK. Rattles it.
TER CONT'D
This isn't a trick lock... it's been
switched out for a real one.
The Judge stares at the tank, appaled.
JUDGE
What a way to kill someone. Why in
God's name go to such lengths?
TER
These are magicians, you honour.
Showmen. Men who live by dressing
up plain and sometimes brutal truths
to amaze. To shock.
JUDGE
Even without and audience?
Cutter stares at the tank
  ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES.
TER
There was and audience.
