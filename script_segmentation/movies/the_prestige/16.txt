INT. COURTROOM  DAY

The PROSEOR turns to face the witness in the box Cutter.
PROSEOR
And did Robert Angier, the Great
Danton, your employer, get to that
final part of his trick that night?
TER
No, sir. Something went wrong.
PROSEOR
What went wrong?
TER
I saw a someone head below the
stage... I followed... and I found
BORDEN
Cutter points at the dock Borden is there, CHAINED TO THE
FLOOR. FLANKED BY GUARDS. Cutter POINTS.
TER CONT'D
watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
PROSEOR
Would you describe your occupation
to the jury please, Mr.Cutter?
TER
I am an ingeneur. I design illusions
and construct the apparatus necessary
for perfoming them.
PROSEOR
And for how long had you been
Mr.Angier's ingeneur?
TER
Eight years. I was privvy to the
secrets of his entire act.
PROSEOR
So, Mr.Cutter, was this waterfilled
tank beneath the stage part of
Mr.Angier's illusion the illusion
billed as THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN?
TER
No, sir. The tank had been used for
the first trick, then taken offstage.
Borden must have put it under the
trap door after the interval.
Cutter looks across at Borden, who is absently tapping his
hand against the rail it is MUTILATED, MISSING 2 12 FINGERS.
The DEFENDER STANDS.
DEFENDER
How large was this tank?
TER
The sort of tank used for underwater
escapes four or five hundred gallons.
DEFENDER
How do you think Mr.Borden was able
to move the tank under the trap door
without anyone noticing?
TER
Ask him he's the magician.
Titters from the gallery. The Defenser turns to the JUDGE.
DEFENDER
IMPATIENT
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
TER
ANGRY
If I reveal my magician's secrets
here in open court, I will be
unemployable and the secrets will be
worthless. The Real Transported Man
is the most soughtafter illusion in
the business and I have te right to
sell it on.
The Judge considers this. He looks at Cutter. Sympathetic.
JUDGE
Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament
but we are talking about a capital
offence Alfred Borden's life hangs
in the balance.
Cutter looks down. Quiet.
JUDGE CONT'D
If you were prepared to disclose the
details to me in private, I might be
able to judge their relevance to the
case.
ADDRESSES LAWYERS
Might this be an acceptable
compromisse?
Amid murmurs of assent, the Judge ADJOURNS the proceedings.
As the Guards begin the complex ritual of unlocking Borden's
chainsa from the floor, Borden's looks across the courtroom
The LITTLE GIRL from the opening stands in the gallery,
looking back at him. Borden gives her a little WAVE. She
waves back, then is GUIDED OUT by a man wearing GLOVES and
BOWLER HAT this is FALLON. He nods at Borden.
