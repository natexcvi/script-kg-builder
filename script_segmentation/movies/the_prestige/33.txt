INT. TENLEY THEATRE  NIGHT

Onstage, CHUNG LING SOO, 60's, wearing a long silk robe,
HOBBLES painfully to the center of the stage. Clearly
CRIPPLED. In the audience, Borden and Angier watch intently.
Soo lays a silk SHAWL and a BARE TABLE. He WHIPS it up,
revealing a BOUQUET OF ROSES. So repeats the trick again
and again, producing a different object each time.
Finally, with a drum roll, Soo whips the shawl aside to reveal
a MASSIVE GOLDFISH BOWL, complete with GOLDFISH.
To THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, Soo bows and HOBBLES off the stage.
Angier, clapping, shakes his head, utterly baffled. He turns
to Borden. Who has a small, knowing, smile.
