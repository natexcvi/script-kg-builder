EXT. PRINCE'S ARMS BAR AND THEATRE

Rough. Unwelcoming. Crowded. A small stage at one end
Borden works his way through the Chinese rings. The crowd
is JEERING.
VOICE
Get out your gun, Professor!
Someone BURLS a bottle at the stage it narrowly misses.
Borden GLARES out into the audience. Pulls out his GUN.
BORDEN
A volunteer.
The crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS. Fallon scans
the crowd, passing over tooeager and toodrunk before
settling on a MOUNSTACHED MAN and bringing him up onstage.
Borden LOADS the pistol, hands it to Moustache and steps
backwards, pulling his coat apart, CHALLENGING.
BORDEN CONT'D
Are you man enought, sir?
MOUSTACHE
QUIET
Yes.
Something in Moustache's tone makes Borden looks closely
behind the moustache... Angier. QUIVERING WITH TENSION.
Borden looks at the trembling gun. Then at Angier. Spreads
his hands, inviting.
BORDEN
SMILES
I think not.
Angier purses his lips, straining to pull the trigger.
  JULIA'S FACE, SCREAMING BUBBLES...
Angier's eyes are almost closed as he SQUEEZES the TRIGGER
Fallon HITS Angier JUMPS to Borden's side, GRABBING his
BLEEDING HAND. The DROWS is SCREAMING, PUSHING for the door,
os STRAINING for a closer look at Borden.
Aniger, SHOCKED, melts into the crowd.
