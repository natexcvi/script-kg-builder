INT. EMPIRE THEATRE  EVENING

Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING
BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses
them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre.
The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage.
Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the
audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor.
ANGIER
Ladies and gentlemen, much of what
you have seen tonight can be termed
illusions. Entertaining trifles of
the sort you may have seen other
magicians perform.
Angier puts on a TOP HAT.
ANGIER CONT'D
Alas, I cannot claim this next feat
as illusion. Watch carefully you
will see no trickery, for no trickery
is being employed. Merely a techique
familiar to certain citizens of the
orient and various holy men of the
Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may
be familiar with this technique, but
for those of you who aren't, do not
be alarmed, what you are about to
see is considered safe...
Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the righthand
door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold.
Then strolls through crossing the stage
to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its
solidity, then walking trough the frame.
Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air.
It sails back down to him and he catches it.
Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it
disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear
it's not coming back down.
LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
back down to him. He catches it.
Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door steps behind it...
The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and
ANGIERROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT.
BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat.
The AUDIENCE ERUPTS A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one
in his seat as AngierRoot takes his BOWS.
