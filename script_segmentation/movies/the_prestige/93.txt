INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP  DAY

A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools,
cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden
is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe.
Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her,
turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves.
OLIVIA
LOOKING AROUND
Interesting workshop.
BORDEN
We make do.
OLIVIA
My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
BORDEN
I know who you are. Are you here to
steal the rest of my show?
Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the
shop THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING
NEW TRICK
OLIVIA
No. I am here to give your show what
is missing.
BORDEN
And what might that be?
OLIVIA
Me.
BORDEN
TO FALLON
Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard?
A woman's touch.
Fallon leaves, closing the door.
OLIVIA
I have left Angier. I want a job.
Borden sits there.
OLIVIA CONT'D
I know you have no reason to trust
ME
BORDEN
Why on earth shouldn't I trust you?
The mistress of my enemy.
Olivia is taken aback. Chanes tack.
OLIVIA
Mr.Borden
BORDEN
Alfred.
OLIVIA
Alfred. I am going to tell you the
truth.
BORDEN
Ah. The truth. A slippery notion
in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
OLIVIA
I am here because he sent me here.
He wants me to come and work for you
and steal your secret.
BORDEN
What does he need my secret for?
His trick is top notch. The Great
Danton vanishes and isntantly
reappears on the other side of the
stage  mute, overweight, and,
unless I am mistaken, rather drunk.
Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia.
BORDEN CONT'D
Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking
his bows under the stage?
Olivia meets his gaze.
OLIVIA
No. It's killing him. he's obsessed
with discovering your method. He
thinks of nothing else, and takes no
pleasure in our sucess. I have had
enough. There's no future with him.
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I have actually come to offer you
his.
BORDEN
He has no secrets from me.
Borden stares at her, unsure.
BORDEN CONT'D
And this is the truth?
She gives Borden a challenging smileshrug.
