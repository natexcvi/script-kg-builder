INT. DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT

Angier, Borden and Julia sit around the cluttered room.
Borden is in the middle of a passionate rant
BORDEN
Milton's squadering their goodwill
or a bunch of tired secondhand tricks
ANGIER
AMUSED
Old favourites, please.
BORDEN
What about something fresh? He won't
even try a bullet catch
TER O.S.
Bullet catch is suicide.
They turn. Cutter stands in the doorway, counting out money.
TER O.S. CONT'D
All it takes is a smartarse volunteer
dropping a button down the barrel...
BORDEN
INDICATES HIMSELF
AND ANGIER
USE PLANTS
ANGIER
He can't use plants for every trick.
JULIA
There had be no seats left for the
punters.
BORDEN
Fine no bullet catch. But a real
magician tries to invent something
new, something other magicians scratch
their heads over
TER
They sells it to them for a small
fortune.
Cutter hands Angier some money.
TER CONT'D
I suposse you have such a trick,
Mr.Borden?
ANGIER
Actually, I do.
TER
Care to sell it?
BORDEN
No one else could do my trick.
ANGIER
I could.
BORDEN
You don't even know what it is.
ANGIER
Show it to me twice, I will do it.
Cutter looks at Borden, thoughtful.
TER
I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier.
But if Borden here really has invented
his masterpiece it might well be
something only he can do.
ANGIER
Why?
TER
It might be something only he is
prepared to do.
gestures to the props
my illusions employer, Mr.Milton,
is a skilled showman. But Borden's
right he won't get his hands dirty.
You want to see what it takes to
make real magic go to the Tenley.
There's a Chinaman there who's got
what it takes.
ANGIER
Chung Ling Soo.
BORDEN
Tickets are pricey.
TER
I know a lad on the door. You two
watch his show whoever tells me how
he does his goldfish bowl trick gets
the prize.
ANGIER
Which is?
Cutter gives a sly smile.
TER
Ten minutes onstage in front of my
old friend, Mr.Ackerman.
Angier and Borden prick up at the name.
JULIA
Who's Ackerman?
BORDEN
The most powerful theatrical agent
in London.
Cutter holds out money to Borden, who reaches for it Cutter
grabs his wrist. Serious.
TER
I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
JULIA
I think I had my wrist turned
TER
IGNORING JULIA
Some nights you just can't get it,
can you? If that knot slips when
Julia's on the hoist she will break a
leg.
BORDEN
DEFENSIVE
It's the wrong knot. A Langford
double would hold tighter.
TER
The Langford double's not a wet knot
it's too dangerous. The ropes could
swell and she had never slip it
JULIA
I can slip a Lanford underwater.
BORDEN
We have been practiced it
ANGIER
TING IN
He said no.
Julia glances at Angier.
TER
TO BORDEN
No more mistakes.
Borden stares at Cutter. Leaves. Angier watches him go.
ANGIER
Where's he from?
TER
Where are you from?
Angier nods. Fair enough.
TER CONT'D
He shuffles props for Virgil at the
Hall.
ANGIER
He works for another magician? Aren't
you worried he will steal your tricks?
TER
SHAKES HEAD
He doesn't deal in methods.
ANGIER
How do you know?
TER
SLY SMILE
Because I hired him to try and find
out Virgil's orange trick.
ANGIER
I don't know if I trust him.
TER
He's a natural magician. Of course
you can't trust him.
JULIA
I think he's alright.
Angier turns to Julia. Smiles.
ANGIER
You think everyone's alright.
JULIA
Even you.
Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises.
TER
And Mr.Angier...?
Angier looks up
Learn your aight lines if I can see
you sneaking a peck on your wife's
ankle from the wings, the blokes on
each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.
