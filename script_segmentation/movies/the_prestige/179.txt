INT. MORQUE  EVENING

Borden the tank, ANGIER IS DROWING. His rolling EYES fixed
on Borden, he POUNDS desperetely on the thick glass, SCREAMING
BUBBLES...
Borden, HORROFIED, tries forcing the lif ot the tank open.
It's sealed shut. He leaves the tank and begins searching
around under the stage. He finds a SPANNER.
Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank,
which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY.
WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into
Borden, and both of them onto gournd.
Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto
his side and POUNDS on his back. Water and blood OOZE from
the man's lungs. His eyes are dilated and lifeless
ANGIER IS DEAD.
Borden is frozen, unable to move.
Cutter appears behind him, SHOCKED by what he sees. Borden
turns to look at him, his eyes wild with confusion.

What did you do?
