EXT. RESTAURANT  NIGHT

Borden and Angier watch Soo being helped down from his
carriege by HANDLERS who treat him with great gentleness.
ANGIER
You are wrong. It can't be.
BORDEN
It is. He carries the bowl between
his knees for the entire performance.
ANGIER
but look at the man!
BORDEN
POINTS
This is the trick. This is why no
one detectes his method.
Soo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile.
BORDEN CONT'D
Total devotion to his art...
looks at Angier
Utter selfsacrifice. It's the only
way to escape this.
Borden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them.
