EXT. FIELDS, COLORADO SPRINGS  NIGHT

The storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground
as he follows Alley through the moonlit field.
There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if
planted all around them. They stop in the middle of the
field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town.
ALLEY
We do our tests when the townspeople
are asleep Mr.Tesla doesn't want to
scare anyone.
Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight.
ALLEY CONT'D
Not long now.
As they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR.
ALLEY CONT'D
Our equipment requires a great deal
of current. Tesla eletrified the
whole town in exchange for using the
generators when we need to.
The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT. Angier
laughs out in surprise the field is full of a thousand large
LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks
up the nearest lightbulb  as he does, the light in it
extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the
size, it's a normal lightbulb.
ANGIER
Where are the wires?
ALLEY
Exactly.
Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random
spot in the wet soil. The lightbulb FLICKERS on again.
ANGIER
Where's the generator?
ALLEY
You saw it last week.
ANGIER
But that must be ten miles from here.
ALLEY
Fifteen. And I have to ride all of
them before I get to bed.
turns to leave
I will send word for you in a few days,
Mr.Angier.
Angier bends to pick up his lightbulb. As he does, the light
FADES in all of them, and the lights in town come back on.
Angier is alone.
