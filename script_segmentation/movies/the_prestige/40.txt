INT. THEATRE  EVENING

Onstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER.
TER V.O.
A particular awful significance...
Julia stands next to the tank. Milton adresses the audience.
MILTON
Which of you brave souls is willing
bind this lovely young woman?
Milton gestures to Julia the crowd goes wild. Julia makes
a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are
made up to look different from the last performance. As
they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter
in the wings Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE.
As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just
under her toes she KICKS him in the chin.
Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a
particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at
him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot.
Cutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle.
Borden tests the rope it is tight. Julia gives him the
sign with her eyes he steps back. Angier rises to his feet,
grinning at Julia. As she raises her arms to the hook, she
can't quite hide her smile back at him.
Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air.
Cutter slips his STOP out of his pocket as Milton moes
the tank under Julia's bare feet.
Angier looks up at Julia. Proud. She stares out over the
audience, preparing herself. Looks down at Angier, smiling...
Julia PLUNGES into the tank Milton SLAMS the lid shut Cutter
checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle...
Milton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it,
working his magic. Angier shifts a little. Time passing...
Milton looks at Cutter TOO MUCH TIME...
Cutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank Milton RIPS
the curtain down Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING...
Angier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe
into the glass which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and again
the web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her
eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until
CRASH the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage Cutter and
Angier GRASP at Julia FULL her onto the stage Cutter ELBOWS
Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest Borden
wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards.
Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken.
Angier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring
eyes. He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and
forehead. Borden looks on, shen.
BORDEN V.O.
How often I have fought with my self
over that night .. one half of me
swearing bling that i tied a simple
slip knot... the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double. I
suppose I will never know for sure
