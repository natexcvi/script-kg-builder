INT. PRISON CORRIDOR, NEWGATE PRISON  MORNING

Borden is at the fence. Fallon is on the other side.
BORDEN
We go alone now both of us. Only I
don't have as far to go as you.
Borden looks down at his feet.
BORDEN CONT'D
You were right. I should have left
him to his damned trick... I am sorry.
I am sorry for so many things. For
Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her.
Fallon wipes tears from his face. Borden looks at him.
BORDEN CONT'D
Don't cry. Not for me. Go live
your life in full. For both of us.
Borden pulls the RUBBER BALL from his pocket and BOUNCES it
up and down. He TURNS to be led back into the prison,
DROPPING the ball.
The ball bounces gently past the fence. Fallon catches it.
