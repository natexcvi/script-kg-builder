INT. BACKSTAGE  LATER

Angier and Cutter watch the STAGEHANDS clear the stage.
ANGIER
I should have spotted him.
TER
You had a lot of plates spinning.
Angier looks down at the harness in his hands.
ANGIER
Don't suppose they will let us do this
one again.
TER
No.
ANGIER
So what's the climax of our show?
MERRIT O.S.
Show? You don't have a show.
ANGIER
Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment
MERRIT
To perform magic not butcher birds
and break my costomer's fingers!
Clear out, anything here in the
morning gets burned.
Cutter puts his hand on Merrit's arms.
TER
Mr.Merrit
MERRIT
It's done, John. I have hired a
comedian. You know I hate comedians,
which should indicate the may I felel
about your friend's future as a stage
magician.
Cutter nods. Merrit leaves. Cutter turns to Angier.
TER
There are plenty of good theatres...
if we can come up with another trick
and change the name of the act
ANGIER
The name stays.
Cutter sees Angier's resolve.
TER
Right. Well, the new trick will
have to be irresistible, then. I have
a couple of methods to try out, but
we will need a fresh angle on the
presentation.
Angier nods.
TER CONT'D
If you need inspiration, there's a
technical exposition at the Albert
Hall this week. Scientists and
engineers. That sort of thing
captures the popular imagination.
