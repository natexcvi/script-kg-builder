INT. DINING ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN, COLORADO SPRING  DUSK

Angier stares down at the NOTEBOOK, making notes on a napkin.
Through large windows a THUNDERSTORM batters Pike's Peak.
Angier is the only guest in the hotel's massive dining room.
VOICE O.S.
Mind if I join you?
Angier looks around. Alley is standing by the table.
ALLEY
Tesla sends me down here during the
storms. Perfect excuse to come shere
a drink with the Great Danton.
Alley sits, gesturing to a waiter.
ALLEY CONT'D
Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr.
Angier? It matches the scenery
nicely.
TO WAITER
Two of 'em.
TO ANGIER
Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New
York, though.
ANGIER
Why are you here?
ALLEY
The lightning lives here. And noit
much else our work is secret.
Alley glances down at the notebook and Agier's scribbles.
ALLEY CONT'D
A cypher?
Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook.
ANGIER
My profession also deals in secrets.
Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook.
ANGIER CONT'D
It's a rotating transposition that
shifts every day of the dairy. Simple
but timeconsuming to translate once
you have the fiveletter keyword.
ALLEY
Which is?
Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook.
ANGIER
We magicians have a circle of trust.
ALLEY
You have a circle of trust with
someone whose dairy you stole?
ANGIER
Maybe I bought it.
ALLEY
Magicians sell their secrets?
ANGIER
It's how we pay for our retirements
and how greats tricks outlive us.
Alley considers this. Taps the cover of the notebook.
ALLEY
You are hoping to find a great secretin
there?
ANGIER
I have already found it. That's why
I am here.
Angier reaches in his pocket and removes his own, leather
bound journal. He tears a PAGE from it and hands it to Alley.
Who unfolds it ans stares at it.
ANGIER CONT'D
Tesla built one for another magician.
ALLEY
Why would you want the same thing?
ANGIER
Call it a professional rivalry.
ALLEY
Tesla has built unusual machines for
unusual people, but he would never
talk about it.
ANGIER
I understand discretion. I just
want the machine.
Alley looks at Angier. Thinking.
ALLEY
Finish your drink. You will have a
special appreciation for our work.
ANGIER
I thought it was a secret.
ALLEY
SMILES
You are a magician. Who's going to
believe you?
