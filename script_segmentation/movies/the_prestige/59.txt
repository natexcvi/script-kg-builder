INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE  DAY

Merrit nods, impressed, stepping backwards. Angier REACHES
into Merrit's pocket. Removes a dove.
MERRIT
Very nice. Very nice indeed.
Olivia packs up the props. Cutter approaches from the wings.
ANGIER
SMILING
I haven't had a chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theatre yet,
Mr.Merrit.
MERRIT
A lot more beautiful when it's full,
Mr.Angier.
ANGIER
Don't worry.
MERRIT
You all say that. Why sould I worry?
If your tricks don't get 'em in,
someone else's will. Maybe someone
willing to do a bullet catch or a
water scape.
TER
cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People
hoping for an accident and quite
likely to see one, too. What would
that do for your business?
MERRIT
SHRUGS
You have got a week.
