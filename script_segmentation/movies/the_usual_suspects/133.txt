EXT. STREET                                                        159

The car stops. The driver gets out.
IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He
smiles to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the
smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in.
The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls
away .
A moment later, Agent David Kujan of U.S. Customs wanders
into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would
when lost at the circus. He takes no notice of the car
pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the
cars filled with people on their way back to work.
