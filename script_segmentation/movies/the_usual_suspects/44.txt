KUJAN CONT'D
He was dead just long enough for a murder
rap to blow over, then he had lunch.

VERBAL
I don't know about that.
KUJAN
I don't think you do. But you say you saw
Keaton die. I think you are covering his
ass and he's still out there somewhere. I
think he was behind that whole circus in
the harbor. My bet is he's using you
because you are stupid and you think he's
your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be
it. I want to make sure he's dead before
I go back to New York.
VERBAL
Blurting
He wasn't behind anything. It was the
lawyer.
KUJAN
What lawyer?
KUJAN CONT'D
What lawyer, Verbal?
Verbal stammers for a moment, looking around wildly.
VERBAL
Back when I was in that barber shop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois I used to
have
Kujan grabs Verbal's shirt and yanks him half out of his
seat.
KUJAN
You think I don't know you held out on
the D.A.? What did you leave out of that
testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby
Deemer in ten minutes.
VERBAL
The D.A. gave me immunity.
KUJAN
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS
NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or
the world you live in becomes the hell
you fear in the back of your tiny mind.
Every criminal I have put in prison,

KUJAN cont had
every cop who owes me a favor, every
creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living, will know the name of
Verbal Kint. You will be the lowest sort of
rat, the prince of snitches, the loudest
cooing stool pigeon that ever grabbed his
ankles for the man. Now you talk to me,
or that precious immunity they have seen so
fit to grant you won't be worth the paper
the contract put out on your life is
printed on.
Verbal looks at Kujan with utter contempt.
VERBAL
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
KUJAN
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
VERBAL
No. But I am sure Keaton's dead.
KUJAN
Convince me. Tell me every last detail.
