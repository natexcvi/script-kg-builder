INT. RABIN'S OFFICE DAY  LOS ANGELES  PRESENT                 47

KUJAN
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
VERBAL
You wanted to know what happened after
the lineup, I am telling you.
KUJAN
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think
you are talking to? You really expect me
to believe he retired? For a woman?
Bullshit. He was using her.
VERBAL
He loved her.
KUJAN
Sure. And I am supposed to believe that
hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
either.
VERBAL
That was all Fenster and McManus.
KUJAN
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years.
Who else would know the Taxi Service

better? That job had his name all over
it.
VERBAL
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t
Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he                       
knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r
I am telling you straight, I swear.                        
KUJAN
Let me tell you something. I know Dean                     
Keaton. I have been investigating him for                    
three years. The guy I know is a cold                    
blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on                   
three counts of murder before he was                       
kicked off the force, so don't sell me                     
the hooker with the heart of gold.                        
VERBAL
You got him wrong.
KUJAN
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 
of seven times when he was on the force.                  
In every case, witnesses either reversed                  
their testimony to the grand jury or died                 
before they could testify. When they                      t
finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  
five years in Sing Sing. He killed three                   
prisoners inside  one with a knife in                     
the tailbone while he strangled him to                    
death. Of course I can't prove this but I                  
can't prove the best part either.                          
Kujan pauses to drink some coffee.
KUJAN CONT'D
Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that?                  r
He died in a fire two years ago during an
investigation into the murder of a                         
witness who was going to testify against                   
him. Two people saw Keaton enter a
warehouse he owned just before it went
up. They said he had gone in to check a                   
leaking gas main. It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it. Within three
months of the explosion, the two
witnesses were dead, one killed himself
in his car and the other fell down an
open elevator shaft.
