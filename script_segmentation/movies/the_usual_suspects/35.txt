INT. POLICE CAR

SMASH
The hammer punches three huge holes in the windshield and
finally caves it in. Strausz and Rizzi are covered with
pebbles of broken glass. Whitehead clutches his bag in the
back seat. He trembles in terror.
The man standing on the roof doubles over and sticks a gun in
Strausz's face. His face hangs upside down and looks gruesome
 covered from the mouth up in a stocking. By the voice, we
know it is McManus.
McManus
GIVE ME THE SHIT.
STRAUSZ
Give it up.
Oscar hands the suitcase up front and Strausz passes it to
McManus.
