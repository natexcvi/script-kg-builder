INT. LOCKUP HALLWAY  NIGHT                                        11'

A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel
door.
FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement
floor. The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled
pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right
foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It
is clear that the knee does not extend fully.
The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a
steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into
step with the first. Another steel door and another set of
feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet
walk single file down the hall.
The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to
another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and
rivets.
CRANE UP TO REVEAL
ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined
face, making his thirtyodd years a good guess at best. From
his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a
slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean
Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney.                      t
Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest.
VERBAL V.O.
It didn't make sense that I be there. I
mean these guys were hardcore hijackers,
but there I was. At that point, I wasn't
scared, f knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for. Besides, it was
fun. I got to make like I was notorious.
