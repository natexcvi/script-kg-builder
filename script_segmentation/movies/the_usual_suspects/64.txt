EXT. BEACH  DAY

Waves pound across a stone jetty. A MAN sits fishing while
his young son, BRANDO strolls toward the open sea. He pokes
at rocks and seaweed with a fishing pole. He glances down at
Something wedged between the rocks beneath his feet. He
pokes at it. He notes the checkered pattern of the fabric
entwined with the twisted mess. It is the bloated carcass of
THE MAN IN THE CHECKERED BATHROBE. BRANDO pokes it's eye
with the fishing pole. It pops.
