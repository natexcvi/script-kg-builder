EXT. SIDEWALK                                                       154

Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding
people as best as he can.
He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the
police station. He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps,
looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces.
He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside
him.
