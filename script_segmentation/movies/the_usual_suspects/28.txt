EDIE
Cold
I know who he is.
VERBAL
I hope I didn't disturb you.
EDIE
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you
something to drink?
VERBAL
A glass of water would be nice.
Edie shoots a look at Keaton on her way out of the room.
Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger.
KEATON
What the hell do you want?
VERBAL
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys 
KEATON
I did you a favor by standing up for you
last night, but don't think we are
friends. I am sorry, but I have other
things 
VERBAL
They are gonna do a job. Three million
dollars, maybe more.
Keaton is speechless. Verbal sits on the couch again.

VERBAL CONT'D
They sent me to offer you a cut. We could
use a fifth man  a driver  That's all
you will do.
Edie walks in with a glass of ice water and hands it to
Verbal.
VERBAL CONT'D
Thank you.
Verbal drinks slowly. Edie stands over him, her face blank.
It is an awkward moment. She deliberately makes Verbal
uncomfortable.
LONG   FINALLY
EDIE
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
VERBAL
Umm ...
EDIE
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something
more creative?
KEATON
That's enough, Edie.
EDIE
Angry
I don't know what you came here for, but
we won't have any part of it.
KEATON
Edie, please.
Keaton takes Edie by the arm and tries to guide her toward
the other room. She pulls away, anger turning to rage.
EDIE
I have spent the last year of my life
putting his back together again  I won't
have you come in here and  What makes
you think  GET OUT. GET OUT OF m HOME.
HOW DARE YOU COME HERE?
Keaton is pulling her now. She yanks her arm away and shoves
him.

EDIE
Don't touch me. Just don't,
She turns and walks out of the room. Somewhere in the back of
the apartment, a door slams.
Keaton turns and glares at Verbal. Verbal cringes.
KEATON
Get out.
VERBAL
If you will just let me 
SUDDENLY, KEATON LUNGES. He grabs Verbal by the lapels and
lifts him off the couch, moving him effortlessly across the
room and slamming him into the wall next to the front door.
He opens it.
VERBAL CONT'D
Don't hurt me.
KEATON
Seething
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill
you.
Keaton starts to shove Verbal out the door.
VERBAL
Quickly
They are going to hit the Taxi Service.
Keaton freezes. LONG .
VERBAL
New York's Finest Taxi Service.
KEATON
They  That's bullshit. They don't
operate anymore.
VERBAL
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth
Precinct. They are coming out for one job
 Thursday. They are picking up a guy
smuggling emeralds out of South America.
Fenster and McManus have a fence set to
take the stuff.
YELLOW 061194
KEATON
What fence? Who?
VERBAL
Some guy in California. His name is
Redfoot.
KEATON
Never heard of him.
Keaton moves to throw Verbal out. Verbal grabs Keaton and
holds tight.
VERBAL
You have to come.
KEATON
What's with you? What do you care whether
I come or not?
VERBAL
They  They don't know me. You do. They
won't take me unless you go. Look at me.
I need this.
KEATON
Tough break.
VERBAL
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is
this your place?
Keaton is unable to answer.
VERBAL CONT'D
They are never going to stop with us, you
know that. This way we hit the cops where
it hurts and get well in the mean time.
Keaton lets Verbal go and steps back, thinking.
VERBAL CONT'D
As clean as you could ever get, they will
never let you go now.

VERBAL cont had
I am not knocking you. You look like
you have got a good little seam going with
this lawyer 
WHAM. Keaton punches Verbal in the stomach and drops him to
one knee. Verbal coughs and tries to find his breath.
KEATON
You watch your mouth.
VERBAL
Gasping
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing?
That's cool.
Keaton reaches for Verbal. Verbal flinches. Keaton gently
helps him up and guides him to the couch. They bath sit.
Keaton reaches for a pack of cigarettes and lights one for
each of them.
KEATON
I apologize.
Verbal takes one and has a few drags, catching his breath and
rubbing his stomach in pain.
FINALLY
VERBAL
I was out of line.
KEATON
You okay?
VERBAL
I'11 be alright.
KEATON
Well, I am sorry.
VERBAL
Forget it.
Beat
I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
Keaton laughs. Verbal thinks about it for a moment and laughs
with him.
Keaton's laughter trails off. He thinks for a moment.

KEATON
How are they going to do it?
VERBAL
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said
no way.
KEATON
Fenster and Hockney?
VERBAL
They are pretty pissed off. They will do
anything. Now I got a way to do it
without killing anyone
but like I said,
they won't let me in without you.
KEATON
Three million?
VERBAL
Maybe more.
KEATON
No killing?
VERBAL
Not if we do it my way.
LONG 
KEATON
Lost in thought
I swore I had live above myself.
Verbal smiles, knowing he has him.
