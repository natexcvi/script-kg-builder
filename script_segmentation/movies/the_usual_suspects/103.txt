Keaton and McManus step out of the hold, walking slowly and
cautiously back from where they came. They hear the sounds of
footsteps running on the deck above and the occasional
hollered sentence in Spanish.
KEATON
Where's Hockney?
McMANUS
I don't think he made it to the boat.
They come to a corner. They can go left or right.
KEATON
I can't remember which way.
McMANUS
Right 
BOOM  BOOM
Gunshots fill the hallway from behind them. They do not stop
to turn around. Keaton goes left, McManus goes right. They
run in opposite directions with the sound of gunfire right
behind them.
