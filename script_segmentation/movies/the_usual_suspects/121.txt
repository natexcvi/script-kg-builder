INT. RABIN'S OFFICE                                                 146

Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board, drinking from
Rabin's coffee cup. Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through
the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them
once and for all.
RAB IN
You still don't know shit.
KUJAN
I know what I wanted to know about
Keaton.
RAB IN
Which is shit.
KUJAN
No matter. He will have to know how close
we came.
RAB IN
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive
he will never come up again.
KUJAN
I'11 find him.
RAB IN
Waste of time.
KUJAN
To himself
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
RAB IN
What?
KUJAN
Nothing. Something I  forget it.
Kujan shakes his head. He gestures to the desk.
KUJAN CONT'D
Man, you are a fucking slob.
Rabin regards the mess of his office.
RAB IN
Yeah. It's got it's own system though. It
all makes sense when you look at it
right. You just have to step back from

RABIN cont had
it, you know? You should see my garage,
now that's a horror show...                               
Kujan is not listening. He has been staring at the bulletin
board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across
the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all.
