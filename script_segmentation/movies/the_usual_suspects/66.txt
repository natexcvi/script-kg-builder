EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  TWO WEEKS PRIOR                               76

Keaton looks out over the ocean and smokes a cigarette.
KEATON
What do you want to do with him?
McManus kneels in the sand. Hockney and Verbal stand behind
him, staring at something in front of them.
It is the body of Fred Fenster, literally peppered with
bullet holes. McManus stares at him, fighting any flicker of
emotion.
McMAMJS
I worked five years with Fenster. More
jobs, more money than I can count.
KEATON
I am sorry, McManus.
McMANUS
I want to bury him.
KEATON
No time.
McManus springs to his feet and points a pistol at Keaton.
Keaton turns to face him and raises his head. McManus might
as well be pointing a featherduster.
McMANUS
YOU WILL FIND TIME. You are not the only
one with debts, man.

KEATON
No shovel.
McMANUS
WITH OUR HANDS.
77   MT. BEACH                                                            77'
Everyone digs in the sand on the deserted beach with their
hands. They are up to their waists in the hole they have
scooped out. Fenster's body is a few feet away.
HOCKNEY
This is nuts.
McMANUS
Dig.
HOCKNEY
This is fucking dry sand, man. When he
rots, the surfers will smell him from a
hundred yards out.
McMANUS
DIG, YOU FUCKER.
Hockney can see that McManus has truly gone over the edge for
now. Keaton gives him a look that says don't argue.
HOCKNEY
Keaton, we gotta go. They are gonna find
him.
KEATON
Dig.
VERBAL
What are we gonna do?
HOCKNEY
I can run. I got no problem with that.
KEATON
They don't seem to have a problem with it
either.
McMANUS
Nobody runs.
HOCKNEY
This ain't my boy we are burying. I don't
owe anybody.
SCRIPT DATE 52594
McMANUS
We got a deal here.
HOCKNEY
Since when?
McMANUS
Since tonight.                                             
HOCKNEY
Fuck that.                                                  
McMANIJS
It's payback.
KEATON
IT'S NOT PAYBACK. I don't answer to you.                   
It's precaution. You want payback? You
want to run? I don't care. I am going to
finish this thing. Not for Fenster, not
for anybody else, but
for me. This Kobayashi cocksucker isn't
going to stand over me.
Beat
All of you can go to hell.
Keaton turns and digs furiously with both hands. Hockney
takes a moment and slowly starts to do the same.
The four men dig for Fenster. The first to find some rest.
