EXT. STREET  LATER                                                  42

The scene is swarming with fresh police cars. Strausz and
Rizzi are fielding questions from a dozen other cops.
Photographers are everywhere.
VERBAL V.O.
The papers got Keaton's call that day and                  
were on the scene before the cops were.
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three
days later. Within a few weeks, fifty
more cops went down with them. It was
beautiful. Everybody got it right in the
ass, from the chief on down.
