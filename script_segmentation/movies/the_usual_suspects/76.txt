Edie glances toward the men in the hall.
Keaton turns quickly on his heels, facing the others. From
where Edie stands, it looks as though Kobayashi is talking to
a group of harmless maintenance men.
They see A LARGE MAN dressed very much like the two dead
bodies left in the hall downstairs. The man notices Kobayashi
and the others. He stands and stares menacingly.
KOBAYASHI
Ms. Finneran's escort in Los Angeles.
Never leaves her for a moment. I thought
you had like to know she was in good hands.
Keaton's mind races for an alternative. He can find none.
Verbal lowers his gun without being told.
KOBAYASHI CONT'D
Get your rest, Gentlemen. The boat will
be ready for you on Friday. If I see you
or your friends before then, or fail to
check in every half hour with that
unpleasant looking man in there, Ms.
Finneran will find herself the victim of
a gruesome violation before she dies. As
will your father, Mr. Hockney. and your
Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint. I
might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew,
David. Do I make myself clear?
All of the men surround Kobayashi, aching to kill him.
KOBAYASHI
I'11 take care of the dead men
downstairs. We will add them to the cost of
Mr. Fenster. Now if you will excuse me.
Kobayashi walks into the office. Edie turns to greet him.
Keaton slowly turns and watches as they shake hands and talk.
Kobayashi says something they cannot hear and Edie laughs,
her back to the window.
SCRIPT DATE 52594
Kobayashi smiles over her shoulder at Keaton.
All the while, the bodyguard watches Keaton. He nods politely
before Keaton and the others leave. Verbal watches for a
moment more and follows.
