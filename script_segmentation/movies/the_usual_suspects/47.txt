EXT. FRIENDSHIP BELL  NIGHT                                    55'

All five guys stand in a group. It is utterly quiet.
An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the
far end and idles up to them. The windows are tinted too much
to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them and
drives on.
A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley
Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an
almost comical array of leather, silver and suede.
He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and
the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing.
As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot
and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bike
pulls up to them and stops.
REDFOOT and McManus shake hands.
REDFOOT
How have you been?
McMANUS
Good. You?
REDFOOT
Alright. How's it going, Fenster?
FENSTER
Getting by.
SCRIPT DATE 52594
REDFOOT
You got it?
McManus holds up a briefcase.
Redfoot takes it and gets off the bike. He walks over to the
Caddy. The door of the Caddy opens. Redfoot hands the case to
Someone inside that we cannot see. The door closes.
KEATON
Whispering
Snazzy dresser this guy.
A moment later, the door of the Caddy opens again. Someone
hands Redfoot a different briefcase and he walks back over to
McManus.
He hands him the case.
McManus hands the case back to Hockney. Hockney opens it,
revealing the stacks of money inside.
REDFOOT
You must be Keaton.
McMANUS
Jesus, I am sorry. Redfoot, this is Dean
Keaton, that's Todd Hockney, and that's
Verbal Kint.
REDFOOT
To Verbal
The man with the plan.
Verbal smiles.
REDFOOT CONT'D
Are you guys interested in more work?
McManus moves to answer, but Keaton cuts him off.
KEATON
We are on vacation.
REDFOOT
I have got a ton of work and no good
people.
McMANUS
What's the job?
SCRIPT DATE 52594
Keaton shoots McManus a foul look. McManus pretends not to
notice.
REDFOOT
A jeweler out of Texas named Saul. He
rents a suite at a hotel downtown and
does free appraisals. Buys whatever he
can. Word is he moves with a lot of cash.
I'11 take the merchandise, you keep the
green.
HOCKNEY
Security?
REDFOOT
Two bodyguards. Pretty good.
McMANUS
Give us time to check it out?
REDFOOT
I had expect nothing less.
McMANUS
We will call you.
REDFOOT
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
KEATON
A friend of mine in New York tells me you
knew Spook Hollis.
REDFOOT
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah,
he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of
dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got
shivved.
KEATON
I shivved him.
Now McManus is shooting the angry look at Keaton.
KEATON CONT'D
Better you hear it from me now than
somebody else later.
REDFOOT
Business or personal?
SCRIPT DATE 52594
KEATON
A little of both.
REDFOOT
Ain't it a crime? Call if you are
interested.
Redfoot fires up his bike and takes off with the Caddy close
behind.
McMANUS
To Keaton
What's your fucking problem?
KEATON
One job, that was the deal.
McMANUS
Take it as it comes, brother.
KEATON
This is bullshit.
McManus laughs and walks away. Fenster and Hockney follow.
Verbal turns to Keaton.
VERBAL
What is it Keaton?
KEATON
Distant
Something  I don't know.
Shaking himself
I ever tell you about the restaurant I
wanted to open?
Keaton walks off. Verbal follows him in confusion.
VERBAL V.O.
L.A., was good for about two hours. We
were from New York. There's no place to
eat after one you can't get a pizza that
doesn't taste like a fried fruitbat, and
the broads don't want to know you if you
don't look like a broad. Within a few
days the last of us was ready to go back
to N.Y., but Keaton wouldn't have it, so
he really didn't have a choice. We went
to work.
