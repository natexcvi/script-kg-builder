McManus is positioning himself on the roof of the boathouse.         
He stops and grabs his radio.

If I didn't have to stop and answer you,

To Verbal
I want you to stay here. Understand?
VERBAL                                 
But I am supposed to                                     
KEATON
If we don't make it out, I want you to                   
take the money and go.

Confused
Keaton, I can't just 
KEATON
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find
some place safe. Tell her what happened 
Everything. She knows people. She will know
what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my
way, she will get him her way.
VERBAL
What if I
KEATON
Just do what I tell you.
Keaton turns and takes a few steps. He stops and looks back,
his face marked with guilt and agony.
KEATON CONT'D
Tell her I... Tell her I tried.
Keaton leaves before Verbal can respond. He walks down a ramp  
toward the boat.
He is no more than a few yards out of the shadows before the  
first man sees him.
