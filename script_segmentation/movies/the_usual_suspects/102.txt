INT. HOLD                                                            126

Keaton has come to the fourfoothigh door to the hold. The
door is open slightly. Keaton finds this strange. He pushes
the door open and steps inside. The hold is empty.
He hears a noise behind him. He wheels around to fire. He
sees McManus in the door. His face is covered with blood.
McMANUS
Did you hear what I heard?
KEATON
What happened to you?
McMANUS
Keyser Soze is on the boat.                                 
KEATON
What?
McMANUS
I heard somebody screaming his nuts off.
He said Keyser Soze was on the boat.                        
KEATON
Are you alright?
McManus rubs some of the blood off with his sleeve.

McMANUS
Huh? Oh, It's not mine.
KEATON
There's no coke.
McManus looks around the hold as though he will see four and a
half tons of dope in some corner where Keaton might have
missed it.
The two men look at one another. There is a long, pregnant
silence.
McMANUS
Let's get the fuck out of here.
KEATON
Right behind you.
