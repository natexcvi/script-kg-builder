EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD  DAY                                            94'

Keaton, Verbal, Hockney and McManus sit in a rented sedan
overlooking San Pedro harbor.
Another file from Kobayashi's briefcase is laid out on the
dashboard. This has a map and a good fifty pages of                  
information in it.
KEATON
It's a logistical nightmare. Close
quarters, no advance layout, ten men,
maybe twenty.
HOCKNEY
Can we stealth these guys?
KEATON
Doubtful. With all that coke, they will be
ready  which brings me to sunny spot
number two. Even if one of us gets
through and jacks the boat, we get
nothing.
McMANUS
And if we wait for the money?
KEATON
Ten more men at least. In my opinion, it
can't be done. Anyone who walks into this
won't come out alive.
McMANUS
I am for waiting for the money.
HOCKNEY
Me too.
VERBAL
Did you hear what he just said?
HOCKNEY
If I am going in, I want a stake.

McMANUS
So do I.
Verbal is shocked by what he is hearing. He looks at Keaton
as if to ask him for his decision.
Keaton's cold stare is all the answer Verbal needs. He slumps
in his seat, resigned to the others.
VERBAL
I just can't believe we are just gonna
walk into certain death.
They all suddenly realize the weight of their situation.
FINALLY
McMANUS
News said it's raining in New York.
No one knows quite how to respond.
95    EXT, PIER  SAN PEDRO  NIGHT                                       95
A large boat, sleek and yachtlike, but without finesse. This
is a boat for business  heavy and fast. It is moored to the
pier.
A large crane hoists a pallet of fuel drums from the dock. It
swings slowly over the boat. A man on the dock yells in
Spanish to the crane operator.
