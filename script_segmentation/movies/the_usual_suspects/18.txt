INT. POLICE STATION  HALLWAY  DAY

David Kujan is walking quickly beside SERGEANT RABIN, a dark
and weathered looking man in his late thirties. They move up
a staircase into the heart of police headquarters.
KUJAN
What do you mean I can't see him?
RAB IN
The D.A. came down here last night ready
to arraign before they even moved him to
county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five
minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking
like he had been bitchslapped by the
boogey man. They took his statement and
cut him a deal.
KUJAN
Did they charge him with anything?
RAB IN
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
KUJAN
What'the fuck is that?
Rabin motions for Kujan to lower his voice. He points out
that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks
where a number of other police are working within earshot.
RABIN

much to stick. This whole thing has
turned political. The Mayor was here 
the chief  the Governor called this
morning, for Christ's sake. This guy is

it and lets Kujan in before following.
