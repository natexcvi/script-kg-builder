51a.
Keaton realizes he is standing on a balcony overlooking a
library below.                                                        
He sees Edie working in the library with an old woman. The
two women talk for a moment.                                          
SUDDENLY, Keaton turns with a start. Verbal is standing
behind him.
VERBAL                                     
We are gonna miss the plane.

Edie is smiling and laughing with the old woman.                   
Keaton's face is marked with guilt and anguish.
Keaton turns and walks out of the waiting room. Verbal takes        
one last glance at Edie and turns back to Keaton.
