McMANUS'S P.O.V.
McManus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene.
The crosshairs breeze past Keaton and find a target. A man

He moves to another and then another, picking up speed and
mockshooting the men. He is steady and quick. It is clear he
could take all fifteen in a few seconds.
McMANUS CONT'D
