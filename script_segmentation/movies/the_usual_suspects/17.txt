INT. HEARING ROOM  DAY  LOS ANGELES PRESENT                      2: 

Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached
to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat.
On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA
He is cleaner, better kept, in a wellcut suit and neatly
trimmed hair. He looks older than he did in New York  worn
down.
A flurry of voices banter off screen. Verbal's eyes follow
the voices back and forth.
VOICE 1 O.S.
My client offers his full cooperation in
these proceedings. In exchange, his
testimony is to be sealed and all matters
incriminating to himself are to be
rendered inadmissible.
VOICE 2 O.S.
The district attorney's office will
comply provided 
VOICE 1
No provisions, nothing. My clients
testimony for his immunity.
VOICE 2
MayI be frank, Counselor? I suspect your
political power as much as I respect it.
I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many
faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't
care. The embarrassment he helped cause
the city of New York will not happen
here.
VOICE 1
Immunity.

22A.
VOICE 2                                      
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
VOICE 1
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed
to see if the District Attorney manages
to bring in twentyseven simultaneous
counts of murder against one man with
cerebral palsy. I would think a man with
your job would agree with these alleged
faceless people in City Hall you
mention.
VOICE 2 1
One would think the counsel is veiling a
threat.                                                       
VOICE 1                                     
Counsel isn't veiling anything.
VOICE 2
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel
safer without a job if a man like Mr.
Kint is behind bars.
VOICE 1                                      
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons
possession.
VOICE 2
You are joking.
VOICE 1                                     
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
VOICE 2                                      
Counselor, you are insulting me.
VOICE 1                                    
Counselor, you are bluffing. Shall I push
for misdemeanor two?                                          
Voices mumble off screen. Verbal fidgets in his chair.
VOICE 2                                     
Misdemeanor one. Fine. This is
ludicrous.  
A tiny smile and a genuine look of disbelief flash across
Verbal's face.
YELLOW 61194
22B.
VOICE 2 CONT'D
Clearing throat
As for the rest of the charges grand
larceny, arson... murder  the district
attorney will accept the subject's
testimony in connection with the above
mentioned events and in exchange will
offer complete immunity. The
transcript... The transcript of said
testimony will be sealed and all matters
incriminating to Mr. Kint will be
rendered inadmissible.
Verbal lets out a longheld sigh of relief.
