Bright lights shine on all of them. They squint, eyes
adjusting.
Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with
him. He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then
McManus. Hockney smiles at all of them.
McMANUS
To Keaton
Where you been, man?
VOICE O.S.
SHUT UP IN THERE. Alright, you all know

step forward and repeat the phrase you have
been given. Understand?
The men all nod.
VOICE O.S.
Number one. Step forward.
Hockney takes a step forward. He looks directly into a mirror
on the other side of the room. It is three feet square and we
can make out faint light behind it. It is a twoway. He
speaks in a complete deadpan.
HOCKNEY
Handmethekeys, youfuckingcock
sucker.
VOICE O.S.
Number two. Step forward.
McManus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and
forefinger. He mocks criminal intensity, pointing at the
mirror. He camps up his line.
McMANUS

VOICE O.S.
KNOCK IT OFF. Get back in line.
McManus steps back.
The rest of the men do their bit as Verbal speaks.

VERBAL V.O.
It was bullshit. The whole rap was a

together. Who knows what can happen?
