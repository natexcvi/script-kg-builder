INT. HOLLYWOOD ATHLETIC CLUB  DAY  TWO WEEKS PRIOR              64'

Keaton stands while the rest sit and listen.
KEATON
So I need to know if anyone can think of
anybody. Somebody with power. Enough to
possibly track us from New York.
McMANUS
Look. We have been over it for an hour now.
I say we pack up and run. Let's go back
to New York. At least get out of L.A.
SUDDENLY, The sound of a man clearing his throat.
Everyone turns to the door behind them.
MR. KOBAYASHI a tall, slim, well groomed man stands in the
hall. He has a briefcase in his hand. He smiles politely.
KOBAYASHI
Mr. Keaton?
Keaton stands back and lets him in. Kobayashi looks them
over.
KOBAYASHI CONT'D
I am Mr. Kobayashi. I have been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal to you
gentlemen. That must be Mr. Hockney. I
recognize Mr. Fenster from his mug shot,
as well as Mr. McManus.
To Verbal
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint.
I believe you were the one who disposed
of Saul. My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.
Everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know
this.
KEATON
What can we do for you?
BLUE 060194
KOBAYASHI
My employer requires your services. One
job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I
don't expect all of you to live, but
those who do will have ninetyone million
dollars to divide any way they see fit.
KEATON
Who's your boss?
KOBAYASHI
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
KEATON
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this
is. You don't work with me if I work with
you without knowing who I am working for.
Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
KOBAYASHI
I work for Keyser Sate.                                   
A strange look crosses Keaton's face. Skepticism, mockery and
just a hint of fear. Hockney, McManus and Fenster all share
similar looks.
KEATON
What is this?
VERBAL
Who's Keyser Soze?                                        
KOBAYASHI
I am sure you have heard a number of tall
tales, myths and legends about Mr. Soze                   
I can assure you gentlemen, most of them
are true.
VERBAL
Who's Keyser Soze?                                        
KOBAYASHI
Judging by the sudden change in mood, I
am sure the rest of your associates can
tell you, Mr. Kint. I have come with an
offer directly from Mr. Soze. An order                   
actually.
KEATON
An order.
BLUE 060194
KOBAYASHI
In nineteeneighty one, Mr. Keaton, you
participated in the hijacking of a truck
in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw
steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze
and was destined for Pakistan to be used
in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable
violation of U.N. Regulations. You had no
way of knowing this, because the man
shipping the steel was working for Mr.
Sate without his knowledge.                               
Beat
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
twinprop cargo flight earlier this year
out of Newark airport. The plane was
carrying platinum and gold wiring. Also
set for Pakistan.
Kobayashi turns and points at Hockney.
KOBAYASHI CONT'D
Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck
carrying gun parts through Queens 
Everyone looks at Hockney. He smiles shyly. It occurs to them
all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested
in the first place.
KOBAYASHI CONT'D
 guns allegedly set to be destroyed by
the state of New York. They were to be
lost in a weigh station and routed to
Belfast. Again, Mr. Sate using pawns who                   
had no knowledge.
turning to Verbal
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.
Verbal crumbles under his stare.
KOBAYASHI CONT'D
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze less                      
than intelligent couriers was taken in a
complicated confidence seam by a cripple.
He was relieved of sixtytwo thousand
dollars. Now
To all of them
 It has taken us some time to find you.
Our intention was to approach you after
your apprehension in New York.
BLUE 060194
KEATON
You set up the lineup.
KOBAYASHI
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were                   
not to be released until I came to see
you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms.
Finneran, was a bit too effective in
expediting his release. Holding the rest
of you became a moot point.
KEATON
What about Redfoot?
KOBAYASHI
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t
works with the same people for very long,
and they never know who they are working
for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no
people.
FENSTER
So why tell us?
KOBAYASHI
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze.                    
That you did not know you stole from him
is the only reason you are still alive,
but he feels you owe him. You will repay
your debt.
HOCKNEY
Who is this guy? How do we know you work
for Soze
KOBAYASHI
I don't think that is relevant, Mr.
Hockney. The five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg and his
bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can attest to
your involvement, and we can see to it
that he will. He is not of your
superior breed.
MCMANUS
This is a load of shit.
KOBAYASHI
The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr. Soze's
primary interest, as I am sure you all
know, is narcotics. He's been  competing
shall we say, with a group of
YELLOW 061194
KOBAYASHI cont had
Argentinians for several years. Competing
with Mr. Soze has taken its toll. These
Argentinians are negotiating the sale of
ninetyone million dollars in cocaine in
three days time. Needless to say, this
purchase will revitalize the diminishing
strength of their organization. Mr. Soze
wants you to stop the deal. If you
choose, you may wait until the buy.
Whatever money changes hands is yours.
The transaction will take place on a boat
in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants you to get
to the boat and destroy the cocaine on
board. Then you are free of your
obligation to Mr. Soze.
KEATON
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
kill you right now.
Kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front
of him.
KOBAYASHI
A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen.
He turns and walks out of the room.
Keaton walks over to the case and opens it. He reaches in and
pulls out five thick manila envelopes, each marked in bold
black letters. KEATON, McMANUS, HOCKNEY, FENSTER and
KINT
Keaton pulls out the files, revealing a map underneath.
Keaton hands each man his file. He opens his first. He pulls
out a thick stack of papers and thumbs through them.
KEATON
Jesus Christ. Open them.
All of the men open their files. Inside are mug shots of each
man in his respective file as well as a printout of his
criminal record. But there is more.
HOCKNEY
They know everything.
McMANUS
This is my life in here. Everything I have
done since I was eighteen.
BLUE 060194
FENSTER
Everybody I ever worked with, did time
with.
HOCKNEY
They fucking know everything.
Keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of
himself and his lawyer EDIE FINNERAN. They are laughing arm
in arm by a fountain in New York. He hides the photo from the
others.
KEATON
This is not right.
FENSTER
I don't know. Who was that guy that used
to talk about Soze in New York?                            
McMANUS
Bricks Marlin.
FENSTER
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff. Always five times more
money than the job was worth.
KEATON
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This
Kobayashi is using him for window
dressing .
FENSTER
I don't know. This is bad.
HOCKNEY
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D.
I think it's a setup.
FENSTER
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of                    
butcher. No pity.
KEATON
There' is no Keyser Soze
Verbal thumbs through his file. A long list of names,
numbers, addresses. It is a detailed portfolio of his entire
criminal and personal life. He looks up at Keaton.
