INT. HALLWAY  DAY                                                   31

Verbal stands in front of an apartment door. He hesitates for
a long moment before he knocks.
After a moment, the door opens and Keaton stands on the other
side of it. He is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette.
He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever.
KEATON
What are you doing here'! How did you find
me?
VERBAL
I just asked one of the detectives
downtown. He seemed pretty happy to tell
me.
Keaton curses under his breath and motions for Verbal to come
in.
