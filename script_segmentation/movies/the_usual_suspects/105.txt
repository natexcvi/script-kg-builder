INT. CABIN                                                         129

The man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching
the door. He hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too
far away.
He crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the
bulkhead. Only the top of his head is visible. He starts to
cry.
BOOM  BOOM  Two shots just outside in the hall.
SUDDENLY, the door bursts open. Jaime collapses in a heap on
the floor, a bullet hole in his eye.
A FIGURE LOOMS IN THE DOOR
The man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure. We cannot see
him.
MAN IN ROBE
I told them nothing.
BOOM
The man in the robe falls dead.
