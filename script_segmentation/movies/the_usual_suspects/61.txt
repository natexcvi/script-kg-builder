BAER
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice. He has a file on Sate in
D.C. It's been a hobby of his for a few
years. A lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on the Incredible Hulk.
RABIN                                     
Had you heard of him before?                                
BAER
On the street? A few times. Outside
stuff. Somebody was working for a guy who
was working for a guy who got money
through Keyser Soze. That kind of shit.
Could be an old badge. A hex sign to keep
people from fucking with you back when a
name meant something.
RAB IN
But you are here.
BAER
Shit yeah. I got a guy trying to walk out
of the hospital on d fried drumstick to
get away from SOZE. I'11 run it up the
flagpole.
