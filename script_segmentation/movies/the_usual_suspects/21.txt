INT. HOSPITAL ROOM                                                   25

 .. DENOTES LINES SPOKEN IN HUNGARIAN                          
Baer comes to an abrupt halt at the foot of a bed surrounded
by a massive tangle of medical equipment. In the center of it
all is the as yet unnamed ARKOSH KOVASH, midthirties. His
body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from waist
to chin.
BOLD IS OVERLAPPED                                                
KOVASH                                s
Are you the police? I need the
police. He will find out I am here and                      
he will kill me. I need the police. I
will tell them anything they want to
know. Please, I am going to be
killed.
BAER
will he die?
PLUMBER
There's a chance.
Baer walks over to Rovash and kneels down on the bed beside
him.
He looks closely at his battered and scalded face. He listens
to him far a moment. Kovash goes on incessantly.
KOVASH
Find someone who understands me,
you idiot, I am going to be killed,                     
You will all be killed if he has to do
it. Help me, God. They are all stupid.
Get someone who understands me or
we are all going to die.

30A.
Baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket and dials.
BAER
Call hospital security and put a man on
the door until the police get here.
KOVASH
Why are you just standing there,
you idiot? I am not speaking English
am I? Wouldn't it make sense to find
someone who could talk to me so you
could find the person that set me on
fire, perhaps? He is the Devil.
You have never seen anyone like Keyser
Soze in all your miserable life you
idiot. Keyser Soze. Do you at least
understand that? Keyser Soze. The
Devil himself. Or are you American
policemen io stupid that you haven't
even heard of him. Keyser Soze, you
ridiculous man. KEYSER SOZE . 
BLUE 060194
Ridgly runs out of the room. Kovash babbles louder and
louder, trying to get Baer's attention. Baer sticks a finger
in one ear to block him out and hear the phone.
PLUMBER
Is he dangerous?
BAER
Yes.
Someone picks up on the other end of the phone.
BAER CONT'D
Joel, it's Baer. I am down at L.A. county.
The guy they pulled out of the harbor is
ARKOSH Kovash... Yes, I am sure... No,
he's all fucked up... What? I can't hear
you.
To Arkosh
Shut up, Hugo, I am on the phone.
Into Phone
Yes... No... Not until I put someone on
him. Listen, I need you to send me
someone who can speak Hungarian. He's
awake and talking like a Thai hooker...
How should I know? Get me someone who can
talk to him 
Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said. In
the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has
spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention.
He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed.
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words
again.
KOVASH
Keyser  Soze.                                               
BAER
What?
He waves his hand, gesturing for Kovash to say it again.
KOVASH
Keyser  Soze.
BAER
No shit?
Into Phone
Joel, call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.
