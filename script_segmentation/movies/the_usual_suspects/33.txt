INT. POLICE CAR

Strausz looks in the rearview mirror. The white minivan is
flashing his highbeams.
STRAUSZ
What the
RIZZI
LOOK OUT.
Strausz looks in front of him. A green minivan swerves in
front of them from out of nowhere. Strausz slams on the
brakes and skids to a halt. The white minivan rams them from
behind.
Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans
screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with
only a few inches between them.
The cruiser is surrounded on all sides.
SUDDENLY, SHOTGUN BARRELS come through the open windows. They
come to rest, one on Strausz's left temple one on Rizzi's
right. RIZZI looks out of the corner of his eye.
He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun
with one hand. A stocking is over the driver's head.
Strausz looks straight ahead. The minivan in front of them is
missing a back window. Another man with a stocking on his
head aims a submachine gun at them from inside.
By the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun, we
know it is Verbal.
Strausz and Rizzi raise their hands without being asked.
