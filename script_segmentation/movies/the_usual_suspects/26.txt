EXT. POLICE STATION  NIGHT  NEW YORK  SIX WEEKS PRIOR         30

Keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police
station and lights a cigarette. Edie comes out behind him,
fuming mad.
EDIE
...and the desk Sergeant is actually
trying to tell me he can't release you?
Can you believe that? You weren't even
charged. New York police  Jesus. I want
to take pictures of your face to bring to
the D.A. first thing in the morning.
KEATON
Just forget about it.
He looks across the street and sees Fenster and McManus
talking by a newsstand. McManus is thumbing through
magazines.
EDIE
Absolutely not.
Keaton looks to his right and sees Hockney trying to hail a
cab.
EDIE CONT'D
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand
jury by Monday.
KEATON
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this
right now. What did Renault and Fortier                    
say?
EDIE
They want more time to think about
investing.
KEATON
Goddamnit.
EDIE
They just said they wanted time.
KEATON
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me
a little more, that's what. No matter how
well you cover my tracks now, they will
find out who I am.

EDIE
Give me some credit. I got you this far,
let's go to the grand jury. This is never
going to stop if we 
KEATON
No. It's never going to stop, period. It
won't take more than a week before every
investor in this city is walking away
from us. It's finished. I am finished.
Just then, Verbal bumps into him on his way out the door. He
excuses himself and hobbles down the steps, oblivious to who
he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs.
EDIE
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
KEATON
They will never stop.
EDIE
I love you.
KEATON
To himself
They ruined me tonight.
EDIE
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops. He turns, realizing it
is Keaton on the steps.
EDIE CONT'D
Let's just go to my place. We will worry
about this tomorrow.
Keaton and Verbal look at one another for a moment. Keaton
then looks over to the newsstand and sees Fenster looking at
him.
KEATON
Huh?
McManus notices Fenster and glances up from his magazine to
see what he is looking at.                                             
EDIE
Come home with me, please. Dean?
SCRIPT DATE 52594
Keaton looks at Hockney who has one foot in a cab. He is
looking at Fenster and McManus who are looking at Keaton.
This makes Hockney look up at Keaton as well.
SUDDENLY, Edie tunes in to what is going on. She notices the
others on the street. She reaches over and takes Keaton by
the arm, pulling gently. She glares at the others.
EDIE
Come home, Dean.
KEATON
Distant
Alright.
Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the
street. Fenster, McManus and Hockney all look at him and then
at each other. It is a strange moment of unspoken
understanding.
All eyes finally turn to Keaton, high on the front steps of
the police station as he walks away with Edie.
