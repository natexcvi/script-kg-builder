I froze up. I thought about Fenster and
how he looked when we buried him, then I
thought about Keaton. It looked like he
might pull it off.
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.
Rabin steps in and motions for Kujan to come outside.

Rabin and Jack Baer are in the hall. Rabin hands Kujan a             
thick manila folder. Kujan thumbs through it.

A boy came across a body on the beach
this morning. Thrown clear when the boat                  
burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys                   
from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     
KUJAN
And ?
RABIN
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty
smuggler out of Argentina. He was
arrested in New York last year for
trafficking. He escaped to California and
got picked up in Long Beach. They were
setting up his extradition when he
escaped again. Get this  Edie Finneran
was called in to advise the proceedings.
KUJAN
Kobayashi.
Bear nods.
RAB IN
I called New York County and they fared
me a copy of Marquez's testimony. He was
a rat.
Kujan pulls out page after page from the file.
KUJAN
A big fucking rat.

RABIN 
Arturo was strongly opposed 'to going back
to prison. So much so that he informed on
close to fifty guys. Guess who he names
for a finale?
Kujan finds one sheet and notices a paragraph is highlighted.
KUJAN
Keyser Soze
BAER
There's more.
