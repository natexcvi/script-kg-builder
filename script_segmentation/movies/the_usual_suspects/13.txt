INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

Hockney's turn in the chair. He laughs it all off.
HOCKNEY
 my lawyer. I will have your badge,
cocksucker.
OVERLAPPED  
HOCKNEY CONT'D
I know you. You don't think I know
you are on the take. This whole fucking
precinct is dirty. You don't have a
fucking leg to stand on.
VERBAL V.O.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with
explosives. Mean as a snake when it
mattered .
VOICE O.S.
You think so, tough guy? I can put you in
Queens the day of the hijacking.
HOCKNEY
I live in Queens. What the fuck is this?
You come into my store and lock me up in
front of my customers. What the hell is
wrong with this country? Are you guys
gonna charge me or what?
VOICE O.S.
You know what happens if you do another
turn in the joint?
HOCKNEY
I will fuck your father in the shower.
Charge me, dickhead.
