INT. HALLWAY  POLICE STATION                                       26

Rabin walks out of a small room. Behind him, we catch a
glimpse of a workroom with a bench covered with wires.
Kujan comes out a moment later, gently fixing his tie.
Rabin opens the door to his office and Kujan enters. Rabin 
follows, looking up and down the hall before closing the door
behind them.
As the door closes we can just make out the back of Verbal's
head. He is seated in Rabin's office, smoking a cigarette.
