Hockney maneuvers through a mesh of twisted steel, arriving
at a vantage point near the stern of the large boat.                 
HOCKNEY'S P.O.V.                                                     
A black van pulls up and parks near the crane. Four men in
suits get out. One remains with the van and the other three          
walk toward the boat.                                                
On the boat, five men come up from below deck. They are tense        
and cautious around the men in suits. Someone speaks in
Spanish and someone else in Russian. It takes a moment before
anyone speaks the same tongue. They settle on French for both
negotiators.
Hockney sits in the van. He handles a large shoulder bag            
stuffed with plastique. He tests a timer on top.                     
He picks up a walkietalkie.

Are we ready, kids?
