INT RABIN'S OFFICE

VERBAL
That was how I ended up in a barber shop                   
quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
KUJAN
This is totally irrelevant.
VERBAL
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been
nailed in Illinois for running a three
card monte in between sets, I never would
have took off for New York. I never
would have met Keaton, see. That barber
shop quartet was the reason for
everything.
KUJAN
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
VERBAL
The quartet is part of the bit about
Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file,
along with every other thing I had done
since high school, see? Aliases, middle
men. They knew me better than I did.
They knew all of us.
Kujan looks at his watch.
KUJAN
You are stalling, Verbal.
VERBAL
Give a guy a break, huh?
KUJAN
What happened?
Verbal slumps a bit. He realizes his stalling tactic has
failed.
VERBAL
We woke up the next morning and Fenster
was gone. He couldn't handle the idea of
slumming for SOZE. He left a note wishing
us good luck and took a chunk of the
money we had scraped together.

KUJAN
Then what?
VERBAL
McManus was furious. He was talking about
tracking him down and ripping his heart
out and all sorts of shit. That night we
got the call.
KUJAN
What call?
VERBAL
Kobayashi told us where we could find
Fenster.
