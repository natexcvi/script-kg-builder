INT. FRONT VAN

Through the front windshield of the front van we see Keaton
at the wheel. Verbal is behind him leaning out the back
window.
Beneath Keaton's stocking mask we see he is trembling and
sweating  sickened by what he is doing.
He glances up at the rearview mirror and looks at the scene
outside. He looks down at the floor in shame, shaking his
head.
