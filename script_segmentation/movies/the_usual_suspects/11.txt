INT. INTERROGATION ROOM  NIGHT

McManus sits in a chair in front of a white wall. He smiles
at someone offscreen.
OVERLAPPED
MCMANUS  
This has to be embarrassing for you
guys, huh? I mean you know and I know
this is a load of shit, but at least I
don't have a captain with his dick in
my ass making me play along. That has
got to suck,
VOICE O.S.                                 
Are you done?                                            
McManus                                   
Do you work for a broad? That would
have to be the worst.                                     
VOICE 0.8.                                 
Are you done?                                             
McMANUS                                   
Still, I guess dignity is a small
pries to pay for medical and a
pension. A small pension, mind you,
but a pension nonetheless.                                
VERBAL V.O.
They drilled us all night. Somebody was
pissed about that truck getting knocked
off and the cops had nothing. They were
hoping somebody would slip. Give them
something to go on. They knew we wouldn't
fight it because they knew how to lean on
us. They had been doing it forever. Our
rights went right out the window. It was
a violation. I mean disgraceful.

VERBAL V.O.
They went after McManus first. He was a
good guy. Crazy though. A top notch entry
man .
VOICE O.S.
So where had you dump the truck?
McMANUS
What truck?
VOICE O.S.
The truck with the guns, fucko.
McMANUS
You kill me, you really do. Where's my
phone call?
VOICE O.S.
Right here. Suck it out.
McMANUS
Clever guy.
VOICE O.S.
You want to know what your buddy Fenster
told us?
BLUE 060194
McMANUS
Do I look stupid enough to fall for that?
Jesus Christ. Beat me if you gotta, but
no more of the candyland tactics, man.
VOICE O.S.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING TRUCK?
