INT. WORKSHOP

Rabin stands over LOUIS, a messy looking technician at his
workbench in a room full of electronic equipment. He adjusts
several dials on a receiver until the voices of Kujan and
Verbal come clearly through a tinny speaker on the wall.
Rabin reaches over for a nearby pot of coffee.
KUJAN VOICE
I know you liked Keaton I know you think
he was a good man.
VERBAL VOICE
I know he was good.
KUJAN VOICE
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
