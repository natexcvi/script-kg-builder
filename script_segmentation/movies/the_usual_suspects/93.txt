Hockney, suddenly oblivious to the sound of gunfire, opens
one of the crates and looks inside.
IT IS FILLED WITH MONEY. Cash and negotiable bonds of all
kinds.
He smiles.
BOOM
BLOOD sprays all over the money. Hockney looks at it,
puzzled.
Hockney raises a bloodsoaked hand from his belly.                   
He turns and stares in horror.
