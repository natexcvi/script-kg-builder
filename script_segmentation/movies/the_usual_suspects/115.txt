EXT. BARGE  NIGHT  ONE WEEK PRIOR                               140'

Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the
barge.
VERBAL'S P.O.V.
Keaton's body is completely obscured.
The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton,
stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck.
He walks up and stands over Keaton. The two men exchange
words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol. He points
it at Keaton.
RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND VERBAL
Verbal turns. He can just make out police cars coming in the
distance.
BANG
Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in
time to see the man in the suit running across the deck
toward the gangway.
Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. The man
in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the
barge. Verbal strains to see but he cannot.
The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter.
He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight.
A moment later flames leap up from on the deck.
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at
its base.                                                            
MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.                                              
Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
out of control.
SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET             
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

darkness.
