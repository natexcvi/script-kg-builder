INT. CORRIDOR

JAIME, one of the men from the boat, is halfpushing, half
helping a thin and sweaty looking MAN IN A CHECKERED BATHROBE
towards a cabin at the end of the hall.
The man in the robe is trembling. He seems stricken with
fear.
BLUE 060194
MAN IN ROBE
He's here. I saw him on deck.
Jaime pushes him inside the cabin and shuts the door.
A stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the man's
panicked breathing.
The man in the robe screams through the closed door, his
voice echoing off of the metal bulkheads.
MAN IN ROBE
CONT'D
I'M TELLING YOU IT'S KEYSER SOZE.                           
Jaime stands outside the door of the cabin and turns to face
down the hall. Off in some other part of the boat, he can
hear McManus wailing like a banshee and the everless
frequent sound of gunshots.
