INT. RABIN'S OFFICE                                                 149

Kujan still stares at the bulletin board.
SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes. He leans in closer to the
bulletin board and squints his eyes. His face changes again.
First a look of puzzlement, then confusion  finally
realization.
The coffee cup tumbles from his hand. It hits the floor with
the SMASH of cheap porcelain. Coffee splatters everywhere.
Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise.
KUJAN'S P.O.V.
Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at
the bulletin board itself.
His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the
wall. One might note it's sturdy construction and it's
convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten
and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that
has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a
use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board
for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a               
bulletin board.
Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the
manufacturer's name.
YELLOW 061194
It reads QUARTET  SKOKIE, ILLINOIS
Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board. He finds a
picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale
in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly
caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an
eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a
THREE HUNDRED POUND  MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it
is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.
Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...
KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization. He runs for the
door.
His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup. The
cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.
Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words
printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the
cheap mug.
KOBAYASHI PORCELAIN.
