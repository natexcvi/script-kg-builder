INT. CELL BLOCK                                                      18

Keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins Fenster,
Hockney, Verbal and McManus. He sits in a corner and keeps to
himself.
Fenster is in midtirade.
FENSTER
Somebody should do something. What is
this shit  getting hauled in every five                   
minutes? Okay, so I did a little time,                    
does that mean I get railed every time a
truck finds its way off the planet?
McManus is silently staring at Keaton, who sits on a bench,
looking away.
HOCKNEY
These guys got no probable cause.

FENSTER  
You are fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well
screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right.
You do some time, they never let you go.
Treat me like a criminal, I will end up a
criminal.
HOCKNEY
You are a criminal.
FENSTER
Why you gotta go and do that? I am trying
to make a point.
KEATON
Then make it. Christ, you are making me
tired all over.
McManus looks at Keaton.
McMANUS
I heard you were dead, Keaton.                              
KEATON
You heard right.
HOCKNEY
The word I got is you hung up your spurs,
man. What's that all  about?
McMANUS  
What's this?
HOCKNEY
Rumor has it, Keaton's gone straight 
cleaning house. I hear he's tapping Edie
Finneran.
McMANUS  
Who?  
HOCKNEY
She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from
uptown. Bigtime connected. She could
erase Dillinger's record if she tried. I
hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
To Keaton
Is it true?
McMANUS
What about it, Keaton? You a lawyer's 
wife. What sort of retainer you giving
her?
SCRIPT DATE 52594
Keaton shoots McManus a fiery glare.
FENSTER
I had say you have gotten on his main and
central nerve, McManus.
KEATON
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him
quiet .
McMANUS  
You are clean, Keaton? Say it ain't so.
Was it you that hit that truck?
FENSTER  
Forget him. It's not important. I was
trying to make a point.
KEATON
Ignoring McManus
This whole thing was a shakedown.
McMANUS
What makes you say that?
KEATON
How many times have you been in a line
up? It's always you and four dummies. The                  
P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head
half the time. No way they had line five
felons in the same row. No way. And what
the hell is a voice line.up? A public
defender could get you off of that.
FENSTER
So why the hell was I hauled in and
cavity searched tonight?
KEATON
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns
gets snagged, Customs comes down on
N.Y.P.D. for some answers  they come up
with us. They are grabbing at straws. It's
politics  nothing you can do.
FENSTER
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole
tonight.
HOCKNEY
Is it Friday already?
SCRIPT DATE 52594
FENSTER
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So
who did it? Own up.
KEATON
I don't want to know.
McMANUS  
Nobody asked you, workin'man.
HOCKNEY
Fuck who did it. What I want to know is,
who's the gimp?
ALL EYES suddenly turn on Verbal. He has been quietly
listening the whole time without uttering a word.
KEATON
He's alright.
HOCKNEY
How do I know that? How about it,
pretzelman? What's your story?
KEATON
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you
guys knew him.
McMANUS
Verbal?
VERBAL
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
HOCKNEY
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
KEATON
We have met once or twice. Last time was
in...
VERBAL
County. I was in for fraud.
KEATON
You were waiting for a lineup then, too.
What happened with that?
VERBAL
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
YELLOW 061194
HOCKNEY
So you did it?
VERBAL
To your mother's ass.
Verbal looks away from Hockney, awaiting a violent response.
Everyone slowly starts to laugh. Hockney looks as if he is
about to boil in his own skin.
KEATON
To Hockney
Let it go.
Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively.
McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of
the cell. He starts taking a leak
McMANUS
Look, we have all been put out by this, I
figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage
a little dignity. Now Fenster and I got
wind of a possible job 
KEATON
Why don't you just calm down'
HOCKNEY
What do you care what he says?
McMANUS
Yeah, I am just talking here, and Hockney
seems to want to hear me out. I know
Fenster is with me 
To Verbal
How about you, guy?
McManus finishes pissing.
VERBAL
I am interested, sure.
McMANUS
There, so you see, I am going to exercise
my right to free assembly.
McManus taps the bars of his cell and the others LAUGH.
KEATON
I am not kidding. Shut your mouth.
YELLOW 061194
19A.
McMANUS
You are missing the point.
YELLOW 061194
KEATON
No, you are missing the point. Shut up. I
don't want to hear anything you have to
say. I don't want to know about your
job. Just don't let me hear you. I want
nothing to do with any of you 
Beat
I beg your pardon but all of you can go
to hell.
McMANUS
Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is
the world coming to?
McManus and Keaton stare at one another for a long and tense
moment. Finally McManus turns to the others.
McMANUS CONT'D
Forget him then.
Whispering
Now I can't talk about this here in any
detail, but listen up...
Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManus's cell as he
begins to speak in low, hushed tones.
VERBAL V.O.
And that was how it began. The five of us
brought in on a trumpedup charge to be
leaned on by halfwits. What the cops
never figured out, and what I know now,
was that these men would never break,
never lie down, never bend over for
anybody. .. Anybody.
