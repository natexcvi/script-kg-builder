INT. RESTAURANT  DOWNSTAIRS                                        10

FORTIER
Edie brought us your proposal and I will be                  
honest. We are very impressed. A bit                       
skeptical, I must admit, but impressed.                    
KEATON
Skeptical.
RENAULT
We find the concept brilliant, but New
York is difficult for new restaurants.
How can we be certain that our money will                  
be returned in the long run?
Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently.
KEATON
It's simple gentlemen, design
versatility. A restaurant that can change                  
with taste without losing the overall
aesthetic. Our atmosphere won't be
painted on the walls.
FORTIER
This was the part of the proposal that
intrigued us, but I am not sure I follow.                   
KEATON
Let's say for example 
VOICE O.S.
This I had to see myself.
Keaton looks up. He sees David Kujan. Behind him are the very
serious looking guys in suits.
Keaton is not happy to see them.
KEATON
Dave. I am in a meeting.
KUJAN
Time for another one.
KEATON
This is my attorney, Edie Finneran.

KEATON cont had
This is Mr. Renault and Mr. Fortier.
Everyone, this is David Kujan.
KUJAN
Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.
Gestures to men behind him
These gentlemen are with the New York
police department. You look great,
Keaton. Better than I would have thought.
RENAULT
Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?
KUJAN
The small matter of a stolen truckload
of guns that wound up on a boat to
Ireland last night.
Renault and Fortier's confusion is giving way to suspicion.
FORTIER
Mr. Keaton?
KEATON
If you will excuse us for a moment,
gentlemen.
KUJAN
We need to ask you some questions
downtown. You will be quite awhile.
Renault starts to get up.
RENAULT
We should leave you to discuss whatever
this is.
KEATON
Please. Sit.
Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to
cover the check. He looks at Edie. She moves to stand, but he
sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.
KEATON
Enjoy the meal.
To Edie
I'LL call you.
Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away.
YELLOW 061194
He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the
restaurant. Everyone is looking at him with some level of
surprise. If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he
hides it well.
