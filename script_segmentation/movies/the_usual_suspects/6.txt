INT. RESTAURANT  DOWNSTAIRS

They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional
exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and
see only two business associates here to ply their trade.
They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is
MR. FORTIER, age thirtyfive, the other is MR. RENAULT, age  
sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
air. They stand and smile.

FORTIER
Edie, nice to see you.
EDIE
Sorry we are late.
FORTIER
Nonsense. Sit, please.
RENAULT
struggling with English
You must be Mr. Keaton.
EDIE
I am sorry. Dean Keaton
Renault's hand is already out.
RENAULT
Monsieur Renault. A pleasure.
KEATON
How do you do?
They shake hands. Keaton takes Fortier's hand next.
FORTIER
Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally meet
you.
Everyone sits at the table. All faces are smiling.

Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg. Her hand runs
high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.
Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand
is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.
