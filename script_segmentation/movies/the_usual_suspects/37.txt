YELLOW 061194
McManus takes the money and stuffs it in his jacket. He steps
back and takes the cap off of the gallon jug. He quickly
pours some kind of liquid all over the roof of the car.
STRAUSZ
Do you know who I am?
A hand reaches into the driver's side window and rips
Strausz's badge off of his shirt.
Strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing
at him through the window. On the other end is a masked and
smiling Todd Hockney.
HOCKNEY
We db now, Jerkoff.
McManus lights a pack of matches and drops them on the roof
of the car as he jumps off. THE LIQUID IGNITES, the roof of
the car is instantly in flames.
Strausz and Rizzi attempt to bail out, but the vans are too
close for them to open the doors.
The vans pull away.
Strausz and Rizzi escape from the car.
Oscar is trapped inside, SCREAMING.
Strausz and Rizzi stop, each expecting the other to go let
Oscar out.
