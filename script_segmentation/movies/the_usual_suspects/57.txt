Kujan leans into Verbal's face. He hangs on his every word.
VERBAL
He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say                   r
his father was German. Nobody believed he                 
was real. Nobody ever saw him or knew                     
anybody that ever worked directly for                     
him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it,

the will to do what the other guy                         
wouldn't. After a while they come to                      
power, and then they come after Soze He
