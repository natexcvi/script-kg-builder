INT. RABIN'S OFFICE                                                  23 

RABIN                                 
Dave, please.                                            
Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. The        
desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of       
paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out.               
Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking
catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rapsheets, memos and 
postits. This is in the neighborhood of decades. Rabin is a
man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension       
of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.                 
RABIN CONT'D                              
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he                 
won't talk to you. He's paranoid about                   
being recorded and he knows the                          
interrogation rooms are wired                            
KUJAN
This won't be an' interrogation, just a...               
friendly chat to kill time.                              
RAB IN
enunciating                              
He won't go into the interrogation room.                 
KUJAN
Someplace else, then.
RAB IN
Where?
Kujan looks around Rabin's messy office.                            
RABIN CONT'D
No, no, no, no, no.
KUJAN
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope,                 
if it was a hit, who called it in?
RABIN
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   
theories to answer these questions.                      
KUJAN
You know damn well what I think.

RABIN
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter.
He has total immunity and his story
checks out. He doesn't know what you want
to know.
KUJAN
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but
there's a lot more to his story. I want
to know why twentyseven men died on that
pier for what looks to be ninetyone
million dollars worth of dope that wasn't
there. Above all, I want to be sure that
Dean Keaton is dead.
RAB ZN
He's dead.
KUJAN
Two hours. Just until he makes bail.
RAB IN
They are all dead. No matter how tough you                 r.
say this Keaton was, no one on that boat
could have made it out alive.
