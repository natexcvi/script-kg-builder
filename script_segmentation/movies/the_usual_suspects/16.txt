EXT. PIER  DAY  SAN PEDRO  PRESENT DAY                          19

It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene.
Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock.
Police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of
the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and
plastic gloves pick at the remains.
Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the
smoldering remains of a burnedout ships hull.
Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark
suit. He is SPECIAL AGENT JACK BAER of the F.B.I. He is tall
and fit, in his late thirties. He gazes out over the water
thoughtfully.

A UNIFORM COP trots up to him.
COP
Who are you?
Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man.
BAER
Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I. How many dead?
Before the cop can answer, Baer turns and walks along the
line of body bags.
COP
Fifteen so far. We are still pulling some
bodies out of the water.
Baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition.
COP
Looking for anyone in particular?
Baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused.
BAER
f don't want any of the bodies taken away
until I have had a chance to go over this,
understood?
COP
I have to clear the scene. I have got word
direct from the Chief
Baer lights a cigarette, only half listening.
BAER
Unimpressed
Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any
survivors?
COP
Two. There's a guy in county hospital,
but he's in a coma. The D.A. has the
other guy  A cripple  from New York I
think. Listen, the Chief said 
BAER
Excuse me.
Baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely. He
wanders through the carnage on the pier.

20 MT. OCEAN
A half mile out from the pier.
The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. An object floats into
view a few feet away, bobbing in the water.
It is A DEAD BODY  a man, face down, wearing a CHECKERED
BATHROBE. He drifts quietly toward the open ocean.
