INT. RABIN'S OFFICE  DAY  PRESENT                               141

KUJAN
Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
VERBAL
Wha No.
KUJAN
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
Department. He swore out a statement to
Federal Marshals that he had seen and
could positively identify one Keyser Soze
and had intimate knowledge of his
business, including, but not exclusive
to, drug trafficking and murder.
VERBAL
I never heard of him.
KUJAN
His own people were selling him to a gang
of Hungarians. Most likely the same
Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
back in Turkey. The money wasn't there
for dope. The Hungarians were going to
buy the one guy that could finger Soze
for them.
VERBAL
I said I never heard of him.
KUJAN
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his
extradition advisor. She knew who he was
and what he knew.
VERBAL
I don't
KUJAN
There were no drugs on that boat. It was
a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the
one man that could finger Keyser Soze so                  
Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he
knew he could march into certain death.
VERBAL
But how  wait. You are saying SOZE sent                  t
us to kill someone?

KUJAN
I am saying Keaton did.
Verbal cannot grasp this. He squints, trying to understand.
KUJAN CONT'D
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.
If you all knew Soze could find you
anywhere, why was he ready to send you
off with the money when he could have
used you to take the boat?
VERBAL
He wanted me to live.
KUJAN
Why did he want you to live? A onetime                     
dirty cop without a loyalty in the world
finds it in his heart to save a worthless
ratcripple? No, sir. Why'
VERBAL
Edie.
KUJAN
I don't buy that reform story for a
minute. And even if I did, I certainly
don't believe he would send you to
protect her. So why?
VERBAL
Because he was my friend.
KUJAN
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton
didn't have friends. He saved you because
he wanted it that way. It was his will.
Verbal grinds to a mental halt, trying to grasp the
implication .
SUDDENLY
VERBAL
No...
KUJAN
Keaton was Keyser Soze
VERBAL
NO.
SCRIPT DATE 52594
KUJAN
The kind of guy who could wrangle the
wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
The kind of man who could engineer a
police lineup from all his years of
contacts in N.Y.P.D.
Verbal stands on wobbly legs, shaking with anger.
VERBAL
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
KUJAN
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED
EDIE FINNERAN.
A strange look crosses Verbal's face. Shock perhaps, or
revelation.
KUJAN CONT'D
They found her yesterday in a hotel in
Pennsylvania. Shot twice in the head.
It starts to sink in with Verbal. His eyes swell.
VERBAL
Edie...
KUJAN
He used all of you to get him on that
boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had
to pull the trigger himself to make sure
he got his man. The one man that could
identify him.
VERBAL
This is all bullshit.
KUJAN
He left you to stay behind and tell us he
was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did
you? You had to hide when the first
police cars showed up. You heard the
shot, just before the fire but you didn't
see him die.
VERBAL
I knew him. He would never

He programmed you to tell us just what he
wanted you to. Customs has been

investigating him for years. He knew we
were close. You said it yourself. Where
is the political pressure coming from?
Why are you being protected? It's Keaton
making sure you tell us what you are
supposed to. Immunity is your reward.
VERBAL
BUT WHY ME? WHY NOT HOCKNEY OR FENSTER OR
McMANUS? I am a cripple. I am stupid. Why
me?
Verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his
chair, Kujan looks at him with some pity, but he is too far
in to stop.
KUJAN
Because you are a cripple, Verbal. Because
you are stupid. Because you were weaker
than them. Because you couldn't see far
enough into him to know the truth.
Verbal is crying now. He shakes his head, eyes closed.
KUJAN CONT'D
If he's dead, Verbal  if what you say is
true, then it won't matter. It was his
idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York,
wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
VERBAL
Sobbing
It was all Keaton. We followed him from
the beginning.
Kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction.
VERBAL CONT'D
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe
he's dead. Christ
KUJAN
Why lie about everything else, then?
VERBAL
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to
know you will never be good? Not good like
you. You got good all fucked around. I
mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I
was never going to be good at anything
'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
BLUE 060194
VERBAL cont had
even a good thief. But I thought the one
thing I could be good at was a keeping my
mouth shut  keeping the code. I didn't
want to tell you for my dignity, that's
all, and you robbed me, Agent Kujan. You
robbed me.
Kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it 
on the desk. Verbal actually manages to snort a laugh, but
only briefly, overcome by an apparent wave of nausea.
KUJAN
You are not safe on your own.
VERBAL
You think he's..?
KUJAN
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal.                    
It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a
shield. Like you said, a spook story, but
I know Keaton  and someone out there is
pulling strings for you. Stay here and
let us protect you.
VERBAL
I am not bait. No way. I post today.
KUJAN
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain
Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p.,
unless you turn state's.
VERBAL
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's
tougher to buy the cheapest bagman than
it is to buy a cop.
KUJAN
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You
gonna run? Turn states evidence. You
might never see trial. If somebody wants
to get you, you know They will get you out
there.
VERBAL
Maybe so, but I am no rat, Agent Kujan.
You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep
my mouth shut 'cause I am scared. I'11
keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by
getting caught  Edie Finneran too. And
if they kill me, it's

because They will hear I dropped dime.
They will probably hear it from you.
Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks
towards the door. Rabin opens it for him from outside.
For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal.
Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye.
VERBAL CONT'D
Fuckin' cops.
He steps out of the room and into the hall. Rabin follows
him.
