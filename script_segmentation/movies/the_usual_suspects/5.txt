INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT  DAY

An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of
a small New York cafe. They are charged with nervous, excited
energy.

5A.
The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in
his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better
than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE
FINNERAN, age thirtythree, poised and attractive  Easily
the calmer of the two.

They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant
leading down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and
stops him.
EDIE
Let me look at you.
Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the
situation. Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.
Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
from his lapel.
EDIE CONT'D
Now remember, this is another kind of
business. They don't earn your respect.
You owe it to them. Don't stare them down
but don't look away either. Confidence.
They are fools not to trust you. That's
the attitude.
KEATON
I am having a stroke.
EDIE
You have come far. You are a good man. I
love you.
Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response.
EDIE CONT'D
Live with it.
She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly
stumbles down the stairs.
