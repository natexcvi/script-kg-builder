INT. RABIN'S OFFICE  DAY  PRESENT                        .         139

KUJAN
And that's when you say in your statement
that you saw...
Kujan picks up his copy of Verbal's statement to the D.A.
KUJAN CONT'D
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
VERBAL
Wait a minute.
KUJAN
Looking at watch
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it
was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you
didn't know who it was.
Verbal is drowning in Kujan's interrogation. He looks dazed.
VERBAL
I  there had to be dope there.

KUJAN
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling.
You know what I am getting at.
VERBAL
I don't.
KUJAN
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT.
THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL
KEATON .
For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from
Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a
corner. Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his
eyes.
KUJAN CONT'D
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW
EVERYTHING .
VERBAL
I don't know what you are talking about.
KUJAN
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING
TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
Verbal looks into Kujan's eyes with genuine terror. Kujan's
face is red, his body trembles. His locomotive breathing is
the only sound in the room.
VERBAL
I don't understand what you are saying. I
saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
KUJAN
Then why didn't you help him?
VERBAL
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure
it was Keyser Soze at that point. I                        
couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to
him.
KUJAN
But Keaton...
VERBAL
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean                    
the Devil himself. How do you shoot the
Devil in the back?
