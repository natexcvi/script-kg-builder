New York's finest Taxi Service was not
your normal taxi service. It was a ring
of corrupt cops in the N.Y.P.D. that ran

OSCAR WHITEHEAD, a tall grayhaired man in his fifties comes

After a while, somebody started asking
questions and the taxi service shut down.
Ever since then, Internal Affairs had
been waiting to catch them in the act.
Oscar stands on the curb long enough to light a cigarette.
After a moment, a POLICE CRUISER pulls up to him. He opens
the back door and gets in.

distance.
