INT. GARAGE  NIGHT

Hockney, Fenster, McManus and Verbal are all laughing in a
secluded garage. They are still in their black clothes from
the robbery. Hockney is throwing everyone a can of beer.
Keaton sits off by himself. He watches the others, unable to
join in the festivities.
The others sit around a cheap card table. It is covered with
emeralds. Dozens of them. Everyone is in awe.
McManus
There's more than I thought.
HOCKNEY
When does the fence come?
McMANUS
Redfoot? He never comes to see me. I have
to go see him.
VERBAL
In California?
McMANUS
Yeah. It will take a few days. Me and
Fenster
HOCKNEY
Hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster?
No, no, no.
McMANUS
Guys, come on.
HOCKNEY
I am sure you can understand my
hesitation.
FENSTER
Then who goes?
HOCKNEY
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
All eyes turn to Keaton. He comes out of his trance.
KEATON
We need to lay low for a while.
YELLOW 061194
McMANUS
Fine with me.
Everyone looks at each other, their moment of distrust
blowing over. All eyes drift back to the emeralds on the
table.
Hockney begins to snicker, then McManus, then Fenster. Verbal
joins in at last.
McManus grabs Verbal and hugs him, shaking him violently.
McMANUS CONT'D
My boy with the plan.
SUDDENLY, everyone yells and pours beer over Verbal's head.
He laughs as he is drenched in white foam, nearly choking as
the others chant his name.
Keaton watches from across the room, trying to smile in vain.
