The elevator opens and Kobayashi is greeted by Keaton and
Verbal. McManus drops from the ceiling hatch and pushes him
out.

Verbal and McManus grab the dead bodies and drag them out of
the elevator. They drag them to the next elevator which has
been forced open, revealing an empty shaft.
KEATON
The answer is no.
KOBAYASHI
Mr. Soze will be most 
KEATON
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no
Keyser Sate. If you say his name again,
I'11 kill you right here.
KOBAYASHI
A strange threat. I can only assume
you are here to kill me anyway. Pity about
Mr. Redfoot.
McMANUS
Fair trade for Fenster.
The elevator opens and Hockney steps out.
KOBAYASHI
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
KEATON
We know you can get to us, and now you
know we can get to you. I am offering you
the chance to call this off.
KOBAYASHI
Mr. So My employer has made up his mind.
He does not change it.
KEATON
Neither do we.
McMANUS
You got Fenster, you may get more, but
you won't get us all. Not before one of
us gets to you.
KOBAYASHI
I believe you, Mr. McManus. I quite
sincerely do. You would not have been
chosen if you were not so capable, but I
cannot make this decision. Whatever you
can threaten me with is... ludicrous in
comparison to what will be done to me if

McMANUS
Just so you know. I am the guy. I am the
one that's gonna get through to you.
KOBAYASHI
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.
To Keaton
f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton.
Mr. Soze is very real and very                             
determined.
KEATON
We will see.
McManus holds a pistol to Kobayashi's chin. The lawyer's cool
eyes never falter'.
KOBAYASHI
Before you do me in, you will let me
finish my business with Ms. Finneran
first, won't you?
SUDDENLY, Keaton grabs McManus' hand and pulls the gun away
before he can shoot.
KEATON
What did you say?
KOBAYASHI
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my
office for an extradition deposition. I
requested she be put on the case
personally. She flew out yesterday.
Everyone looks at Keaton.
KOBAYASHI CONT'D
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
KEATON
You are lying.
KOBAYASHI
Am I?
