A door marked INTENSIVE CARE.
The door BURSTS OPEN. SUDDENLY, the hallway is a flurry of
activity.
DOCTOR LISA PLUMBER, age fifty, walks quickly beside JACK
BAER .
Baer walks with all of the determination of a battalion of
Chinese infantry.
DOCTOR RIDGLY WALTERS, a young intern in his late twenties
rushes up to them.
