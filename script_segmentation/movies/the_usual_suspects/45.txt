   DENOTES LINES SPOKEN IN HUNGARIAN                        
Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands
next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next
to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Sitting beside the bed is TRACY FITZGERALD, a casually
dressed woman in her late twenties. She holds a 15x20 inch
drawing pad on her lap.
Police fill the hall. People are talking loudly outside.
LIONEL BODI, a cop in his midtwenties pushes his way in.
BAER
Are you the translator?
BODI
Patrolman Lionel Bodi, sir.

harbor.
BODI
My name is Bodi. How are you'
Kovash smiles with relief when he hears his own language.
KOVASH
How am 17 You are as stupid as that
one, but at least I can talk to you.
BODI  
You will be alright. He is from the
F.B.I. He is here to help you. He wants
to know what happened in the harbor.
KOVASH                                    
We were there to buy a man and take him                  
back to Hungary.

BODI
He says they were buying It doesn't
make sense. I am sorry, I am a little
rusty. They were there to buy something.
BAER
Dope, we know.
KOVASH 
You don't understand me either? God
help me, they are all idiots.                             s
talking slowly                              
We were there to buy a man, you simple
boy. A witness. I don't know his name. A
witness who knew the Devil.                              
BODI
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He
doesn't knob what they were buying. But
not dope... people.
KOVASH                                    
I will tell you everything. I'11 even say                  
it slow enough for you to understand it.
Just tell this man I want protection.                      
Real protection.

METZHEISER
Your witness is whacked, Baer.
BODI
He says he will tell us everything he knows
if we protect him.
.BAER
Tell him fine.
BODI  
He says that is fine.
KOVASH  
No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the
ridiculous man. I am going to be killed.
I have seen the Devil and looked him in
the eye.                                               
BODI
No good. He needs guarantees. He says...
his life is in danger... He has seen the
Devil... looked him in the eye.
METZHEISER
I'11 be on my way.
Baer grabs Metzheiser by the arm.
BAER
To Bodi
Tell him to tell this man what he was
telling me before. Who is the Devil? Who
did he see?
BODI  
Who is this Devil you keep talking
about?

shooting everyone in sight.                            
Metzheiser is suddenly interested.
