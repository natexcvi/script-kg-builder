INT. POLICE CAR                                                      34

SERGEANT JIM STRAUSZ, a meaty, imposing looking man in his
forties drives the car. Beside him is a thin, greasy looking
PATROLMAN, STEVE RIZZI. They are two drivers for New York's
Finest Taxi Service.
RIZZI
How was the flight?
Oscar hands Rizzi a thick envelope.
OSCAR
Will that get me to the Pierre?
Rizzi counts the stack of hundred dollar bills in the
envelope .
RIZZI
That will get you to Cape God.
The two men laugh. Strausz watches the road, expressionless.
