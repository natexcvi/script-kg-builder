INT. HALLWAY  FORTIETH FLOOR

Keaton, McManus and Verbal stand by the six elevators on the
fortieth floor. They are all wearing khaki overalls and tool
belts with walkietalkies. They look like servicemen.
All of the elevators have been propped open and stranded.
McManus moves into one of the elevators. As the doors close         i
behind him, he scrambles for the ceiling hatch.
