EXT. BOAT  NIGHT  STERN                                             2'

A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on
a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at
it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.
The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles
weakly to himself.
The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out
pitifully with a hiss.
Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the
deck from between them.
BLUE 060194
The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over
to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.
CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of
cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over
the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and
strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,
somewhat showy.
Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his
face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally
resignation.
VOICE O.S.
How are you, Keaton?
KEATON
I had have to say my spine was broken,
Keyser.
He spits the name out like it was poison.
The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.
VOICE O.S.
Ready?
KEATON
What time is it?
The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on
its wrist upward.
The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.
VOICE O.S.
Twelve thirty.
Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and
takes another drag.
The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy  
his last drag before pulling the trigger.
GUNSHOT
The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.
YELLOW 061194
MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline
still flowing freely.
The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front
of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle
around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking
the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.
MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.
The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
fierce firefight.
A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.                                             
On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.          
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon           
beneath its base.                                                    
MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.
Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
out of control.
SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.
MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS
Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness.
SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.
Then silence. TOTAL NESS.
We hear the voice of ROGER VERBAL KINT, whom we will soon
meet.
VERBAL V.O.
New York.  six weeks ago. A truck loaded
with stripped gun parts got jacked
outside of Queens. The driver didn't see
anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard
a voice. Sometimes, that's all you need.
