EXT. BOAT                                                           119

Keaton finds the hatch and goes below, shooting a man on his
way up the stairs. McManus jumps on board and runs down
behind him.
120  EXT'. PIER                                                          120'
Verbal arrives at the top of the ramp leading from the dock
to the pier.                                                        
He ducks down behind a guardrail beside the ramp.                    
He turns and sees Hockney's dead body next to the van.               
He looks around frantically, frozen in terror.                       
It is quiet, except for the sounds of screaming, far off in
the bowels of the boat and the hum of the crane.
