VERBAL
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a
good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let
him go legit.
KUJAN
Keaton was a piece of shit.
VERBAL
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent                  
Kujan?

KUJAN
I just want to hear your story.
YELLOW 061194
VERBAL
It's right here.
He taps a finger on the stack of paper that Kujan brought in.
Kujan picks it up and thumbs through it.
KUJAN
According to your statement you are a
shortcon operator. Run of the mill
seams. Everything you do, you learned
from somebody else.
VERBAL
That's been suppressed. Anything in there
is inadmissible.
KUJAN
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total
immunity .
VERBAL
laughing
Well I do have the weapons charge. I am
looking at six whole months hard time.
KUJAN
smiling
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer,
Verbal?
VERBAL
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
KUJAN
You know Ruby is in Attica? 
VERBAL
He didn't have my lawyer.
KUJAN
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect.
Likes me very much.
Verbal sees this getting to something. His smiles fades.
KUJAN CONT'D
Now I know your testimony was sealed.
Ruby is well connected. He still has
people running errands for him. What do
you think he had say if he found out you
dropped his name to the D.A.?
SCRIPT DATE 52594
VERBAL
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
KUJAN
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Verbal is not smiling anymore. He stares at Kujan with utter
contempt, knowing he is being shafted.
KUJAN CONT'D
The first thing I learned on the job,
know what it was? How to spot a murderer.
Let's say you arrest three guys for the
same killing. Put them all in jail
overnight. The next morning, whoever is
sleeping is your man. If you are guilty,
you know you are caught, you get some rest
 let your guard down, you follow?
VERBAL
No.
KUJAN
I'11 get right to the point. I am smarter
than you. I'11 find out what I want to
know and I'11 get it from you whether you
like it or not.
VERBAL
I am not a rat.
Kujan puts his hand on the transcript of Verbal's confession.
Rabin walks in with a cup of coffee. Verbal takes it with his
good hand and sips it with a relish.
VERBAL CONT'D
Ahhh. Back when I was picking beans in
Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
Right off the trees I mean. That was
good. This is shit, but hey...
RAB IN
Can we get started again?
KUJAN
Now what happened after the lineup?
Verbal sneers at Kujan, unable to change the subject.
