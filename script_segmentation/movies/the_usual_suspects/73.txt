INT. ELEVATOR

The elevator is empty except for the three men. McManus has
vanished. Kobayashi presses a button and they are on the way.
SUDDENLY, the ceiling hatch opens and McManus' arm comes out.
POP  POP. Two shots from a suppressed pistol and the guards
drop to the floor, DEAD.
Kobayashi looks up with surprising calm into McManus' barrel.
McManus
Press forty.
