INT. BOAT  NIGHT  ONE WEEK PRIOR                               124

Keaton is weaving through tight, lowceiling corridors,
looking in every cabin, working his way towards the bottom of
the boat.
ELSEWHERE IN THE BOAT, McManus is tearing though the
corridors, seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as
he is in killing everyone on board.
He screams like a lunatic, shooting everything in his path,
killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others,
stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along.
