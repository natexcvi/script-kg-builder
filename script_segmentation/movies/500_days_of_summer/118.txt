INT OFFICE  LATER

Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the
clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't
muster responses. At his desk,
MCKENZIE
Tom!
Nothing.
MCKENZIE
I have been calling every five
minutes. Are you ok?
TOM
What? Oh yeah. Great.
MCKENZIE
Do you need anything?
TOM
Twinkies?
MCKENZIE
Sorry.
TOM
I am out of twinkies.
MCKENZIE
Well let's go.
TOM
Go... where?
MCKENZIE
It's Thursday.
