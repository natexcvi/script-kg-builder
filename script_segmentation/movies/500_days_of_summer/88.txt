EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING  

Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the
buildings.
TOM
A lot of people have problems with
this, but to me, it makes both
structures so much more beautiful
side by side like that.
Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the
CAMERA.
SUMMER
While you continue to talk about
buildings and whatever other
bullshit interests you, I will just
nod my head and pretend to listen
while secretly dreaming about the
many ways I can one day rip out
your heart and eat it like the
rabid vampire I am.
