INT MOVIE THEATRE  LATER

Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold,
emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact,
something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her
head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.
It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen
assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets
fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away
like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent,
horrible onscreen death.
