INT RESTAURANT  LATER

Tom and Alison eat. In silence.
ALISON
So...uh... how's it going?
TOM
Ok.
Beat.
ALISON
You have been pretty quiet.
TOM
Sorry.
ALISON
I am pretty quiet too. Usually. It's
nice sometimes to be comfortable
enough that you can just sit and
eat and not have to say anything,
you know?
TOM
Uhhuh.
More silence.
ALISON
Do you want to try some 
TOM
No thanks.
Alison looks at her food. Tom realizes he's been difficult,
starts to feel kinda bad.
TOM
I am sorry. It's just... there's
this girl.
ALISON
Oh.
TOM
I am not usually like this. I wasn't
before... Long story short, she
wrecked me. I don't know if you can
tell but it was pretty recent and
I am still kinda thinking about her.
ALISON
DISAPPOINTED
Well maybe you should think
about... someone else... who could
cheer you up.
TOM
I can't get her out of my head, you
know? I see her everywhere. She's
all I think about. And it's
horrible. Cause I totally didn't
see it coming. I thought things
were fine. So now I keep going
through every day in my mind, every
second really. Wondering. What went
wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have
prevented it somehow?
