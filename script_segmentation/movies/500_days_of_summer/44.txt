INT OFFICE  SAME

Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees
him and immediately lights up.
SUMMER
Hey!
TOM
Hey!
Vance pokes out of his corner office.
VANCE.
Summer, I need  Oh hello Hansen.
TOM
Hey Mr. Vance.
SUMMER
Yes, Mr. Vance?
And they are all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer
gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal
for I will call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.
Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.
