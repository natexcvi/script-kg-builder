INT TOM'S CAR  THAT NIGHT

Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very
conflicted and we can see it in his face. They are silent a
few beats, before
SUMMER
Hi.
TOM
Hi.
SUMMER
Are you ok?
TOM
Yeah.
SUMMER
You sure?
He's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins...
TOM
Summer, I have gotta ask you
something.
SUMMER
Ok.
He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when
SUMMER
Wait!
Summer finds on the radio a particular song. Waiting in
Vain by Bob Marley, if you must know.
SUMMER
Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk
during this song. It's too
beautiful.
And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers
there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches
Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the
way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain
notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry
at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply
overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this
girl.
Marley sings
B.M.
In life I know there's lots of
grief but your love is my relief.
We know, as well as he does he will ask nothing tonight.
