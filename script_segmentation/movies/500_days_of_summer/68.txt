INT PARTY  NIGHT

Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.
TIME S reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with,
drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom
notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's
clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention
they are getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that
attention.
