EXT MOVIE THEATRE  LATER

Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
TOM
Hey.
He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs
back.
TOM
Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
SUMMER
I know. I am sorry Tom.
TOM
Is everything alright with you?
She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
SUMMER
Yeah. I am just...I am sorry. I am
being ridiculous.
TOM
It's ok. This happens to me every
time I watch Hoosiers. Let's go
for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.
Or go to Sister Ray's.
SUMMER
Ok.
They walk.
