INT KARAOKE BAR  NIGHT

Summer is in a back booth with some coworkers when Tom walks
in to the crowded place. McKenzie has the microphone and he's
singing Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison. He's real into
it and, well, it's kinda sad. Tom waves to McKenzie and walks
over to the booth.
TOM
Hi.
SUMMER
Hey! They said you weren't coming.
TOM
You asked if I was coming?
I mean...my plans got cancelled...
Tom is at a loss. There's yet another awkward silent beat
between them. Thankfully, it's interrupted by...
MCKENZIE
already drunk
Goddamn that song is brilliant!
What's up Hansen?
Summer sees the next song come up on the screen.
SUMMER
Ooh that's me.
She downs a shot and jumps up on stage.
SUMMER
into mic
Ok. I am the new girl so no making
fun of me.
Her coworkers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep
breath as the opening bars of Born to Run begin to play and
Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in
whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song it's
something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a
midget in a tuxedo.
LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie doing a shot as
Summer chats with coworkers at another table. Tom can't help
but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles,
hopeful that she will come over. She doesn't. He hides his
disappointment.
LATER. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is
there in midconversation with McKenzie.
TOM
You were great up there, by the
way.
SUMMER
Well you can't go wrong with The
Boss.
TOM
sitting down
I hear that.
MCKENZIE
Hey, did you know Tom here's from
Jersey?
SUMMER
Yeah?
TOM
Lived there til I was 12.
SUMMER
I named my cat after Springsteen.
TOM
No kidding? What's his name?
SUMMER
Bruce.
TOM
That makes sense.
She laughs. She's really cute when she laughs.
MCKENZIE
So you got a boyfriend?
SUMMER
Me? No.
Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie
mouths what? Summer sees nothing.
MCKENZIE
Why not?
SUMMER
Don't really want one.
MCKENZIE
Come on. I don't believe that.
SUMMER
You don't believe a woman could
enjoy being free and independent?
MCKENZIE
Are you a lesbian?
SUMMER
No, I am not a lesbian. I am just not
comfortable being somebody's
girlfriend. I don't want to be
anybody's anything, you know?
MCKENZIE
I have no idea what you are talking
about.
SUMMER
It sounds selfish, I know, but... I
just like being on my own.
Relationships are messy and
feelings are always getting hurt.
Who needs all that? We are young.
We are in one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

SUMMER cont had
I say, let's have as much fun as we
can afford and leave the serious
shit for later.
TOM
But...what if you meet someone and
fall in love?
SUMMER
LAUGHS
Love? You seriously believe in that
stuff?
TOM
Of course I do.
SUMMER
Interesting. A real romantic.
MCKENZIE
Oh you have no idea. This one...
embarrassing. There was this one
girl,
to Tom
I gotta tell this story 
Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.
TOM
Summer, hold on... you don't
believe in love?
SUMMER
I don't even know what that word
means. I know I have never felt it,
whatever it is in all those songs.
And I know that today most
marriages end in divorce. Like my
parents.
TOM
Well mine too but 
SUMMER
Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek,
there were these scientists who
found that by stimulating a part of
the brain with electrodes you can
make a person fall in love with a
rock. Is that the love you are
talking about?
TOM
Well...
SUMMER
Why, what's your take on it?
AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY
DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN
ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO.
