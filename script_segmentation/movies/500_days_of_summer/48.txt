INT TOM'S BEDROOM  LATER THAT NIGHT

Summer and Tom come bounding in, liplocked and all over each
other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other.
Suddenly, Tom stops.
TOM
I will be...back in a sec.
He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into
the hallway mirror.
TOM
Settle. Don't get too excited.
She's just a girl. There's lots of
them. Who look like that. And like
what you like. They are everywhere.
Calm yourself.
He takes a few deep breaths.
TOM
Are you calm?
Ok. Then it's time to go back in.
We watch from behind as he reenters his bedroom. Where
Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked.
SUMMER
Hi.
TOM
Oh sweet Jesus!
Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance.
LATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to
her. He still can't help but be ecstatic. He is pumping his
fists in the air and silently shouting Woo Hoo!!!!
