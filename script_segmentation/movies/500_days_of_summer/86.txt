EXT RESTAURANT  NIGHT

Tom and an attractive girl we haven't seen before walk
towards an outdoor cafe. Her name is ALLISON. It's clear
right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already.
ALISON
So how long have you known Paul and
Robyn?
TOM
Since grade school.
ALISON
No way, really? That's crazy.
TOM
Yeah.
ALISON
Well I am glad you called. They
spoke very highly of you.
TOM
Great.
