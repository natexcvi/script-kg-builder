EXT STREET  SAME

Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees
ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees
a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.
TOM
Jesus Christ people! Get a room!
They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.
