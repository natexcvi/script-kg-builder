INT RECORD STORE  NIGHT

Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.
He grabs one.
TOM
It pains me that we live in a world
where no one's ever heard of
Spearmint.
SUMMER
I have never heard of them.
TOM
And it's painful. Oh look.
He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as
we have seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down
the aisles.
In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
approaches hers in SLOMO, she moves it away and keeps it
at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
there's something to read in that.
