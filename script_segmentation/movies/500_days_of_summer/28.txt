INT CLASSROOM  DAY

Little Tom stares at a LITTLE GIRL, 6, who has the same
hairstyle and dress as NewtonJohn on that cover. Tom draws a
picture. It's a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them.
He stands up and walks over to the girl, putting the picture
on her desk. Not a word is spoken. Satisfied, he returns to
his seat and waits to see what happens.
NARRATOR
Exhibit A Lisa Rayner.
The Little Girl stands up and walks the picture over to
ANOTHER BOY.
Tom is mortified. The OTHER BOY eats the drawing.
