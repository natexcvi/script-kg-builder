INT TOM'S BEDROOM  HOURS LATER

Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the sleep button but

gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer.
SUMMER
Say you are sorry.
TOM

SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

TOM

won't wake up tomorrow and feel a

SUMMER
I can't promise you that. Nobody
can. Anyone who does is a liar.

SUMMER
I can only tell you how I feel
right now... or I can show you.
She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second.
Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins
again. He shuts the door in our faces.
