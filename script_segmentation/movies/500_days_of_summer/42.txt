EXT KARAOKE BAR  LATER

Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place. Summer
is with them.
MCKENZIE
to Summer
This guy.
DRAMATICALLY
He's the best.
TOM
Ok, let's get you in a cab.
MCKENZIE
No. I am gonna walk. I live right
down that street. Or that one.
SUMMER
LAUGHING
Is he gonna be ok?
TOM
He will be fine.
A cab arrives. Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside.
MCKENZIE
Hey.
TOM
What's up?
MCKENZIE
Not you. You.
beat, to Summer
He likes you.
TOM
QUICKLY
Ok, goodnight McKenzie!
MCKENZIE
I mean... likes you, likes you. For
real. Tell her Tom.
Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's
just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and
erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
TOM
Sorry you had to see that. Happens
every time we come here. It's
unbelievable. Something about that
guy and singing for people. I don't
know. But at least he didn't 
SUMMER
Is that true?
TOM
What?
SUMMER
You know what. Do you...like me?
TOM
Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.
SUMMER
As a friend.
TOM
Right. As a friend.
SUMMER
Just as a friend?
The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right
answer here?
TOM
Yes. I mean... I haven't really
thought about... Yes. Why?
SUMMER
Nothing. I just... You are
interesting. I had like us to be
friends. Is that ok?
Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He
hides his disappointment the best he can.
TOM
Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and
me. That's... perfect.
SUMMER
Cool.
TOM
Cool.
Silence.
SUMMER
Well, I am that way. Good night Tom.
TOM
G'night Summer.
Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go
the other way.
TOM
under his breath
Friends. Awesome. That's just
great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.
Tom walks a few more steps.
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even
noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED
HIM INTO A KISS!
It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure
if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out
of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually
happening.
