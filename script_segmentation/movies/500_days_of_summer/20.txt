INT TOM'S PLACE  AS BEFORE

Silence for a few beats.
PAUL
Jesus.
MCKENZIE
That's harsh.
TOM
I don't know what I am gonna do.
RACHEL
You are gonna be fine.
TOM
I am gonna throw up.
MCKENZIE
Or that.
RACHEL
Here.
Tom drinks more vodka.
MCKENZIE
Come on Hansen. You will be ok.
You are the best guy I know. You will
find someone.
PAUL
You know what they say...there's
plenty other fish in the sea.
TOM
No.
PAUL
Sure they do. They say that.
TOM
Well they are wrong. It's not true.
I have fished in that sea. I have
jumped in and swam in that sea! I am
fucking Aquaman!
to Rachel
Sorry. What I mean is... there are
no other fish. This was my fish.
Paul and McKenzie share a very concerned look.
