INT OFFICE LOBBY  DAY

The office sings Happy Birthday to a FEMALE COWORKER. When
they get to the part about her name, Tom is the only one who
knows it, everyone else just there for the cake. Song over,
everyone digs in. Tom finds himself standing next to Summer.
TOM
Hi.
SUMMER
Hello.
TOM
So, uh, Summer...
SUMMER
Tom.
TOM
Yeah! How's it going so far?
SUMMER
The city or the firm?
TOM
Both... Either.
SUMMER
I am happy. Still getting situated.
How long have you worked here?
TOM
Oh, you know, 4, 5... years.
SUMMER
Really? Jesus. Did you always want
to write greeting cards?
TOM
Are you nuts? I don't even want to
do it now.
SUMMER
What is it you want to do?
TOM
I studied to be an architect
actually.
SUMMER
That's so cool! What happened?
TOM
Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved
to the city to work for a company.
Company went under. Needed a job.
My friend worked here. Got me this.
SUMMER
And are you any good?
TOM
points to a framed card
Well I wrote that one.
SUMMER
READING
Today You are a Man. Mazel Tov on
your Bar Mitzvah.
TOM
It's a big seller.
SUMMER
I meant, are you any good as an
architect?
TOM
Oh... No. I doubt it.
SUMMER
Well, I had say you are a perfectly
...adequate... greeting card
writer.
TOM
Why thank you. That's what they
called me in college. Perfectly
adequate Hansen.
SUMMER
They used to call me Anal Girl.
Tom does a spittake and almost chokes.
SUMMER
EXPLAINING
I was very neat and organized.
There's an awkward silence.
SUMMER
Anyway, I should get back.
TOM
Ok, well, I will see you around.
She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall.
Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored.
He sits down at his desk and sets out to work. But before he
does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house. It's
dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall.
