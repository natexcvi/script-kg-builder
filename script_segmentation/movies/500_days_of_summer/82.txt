INT TOM'S BEDROOM  THE Next MORNING

Tom and Summer in the wee hours.
TOM
Have you ever had a real
boyfriend?
SUMMER
What?
TOM
A boyfriend. Going steady.
Whatever. You know what I mean.
SUMMER
Well... yeah.
TOM
More than one?
SUMMER
A few.
TOM
Tell me about them.
SUMMER
Oh no way.
TOM
Why?
SUMMER
Cause there's nothing to tell.
TOM
Come on, I am interested.
SUMMER
You wanna have the relationship
history conversation?
TOM
Yes.
SUMMER
You sure about that?
TOM
No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I
can take it.
SUMMER
Ok. Well, in high school, there was
Markus.

appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning
touchdown pass.
TOM
Quarterback slash homecoming king?
SUMMER
He was a rower. Very hot.
TOM
What happened to Markus?
SUMMER
He works for the Republican party.
Very successful. Just not for me.
TOM
Ok. And then?
SUMMER
Well, for a short time in college,
there was Kurt.

Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue.
SUMMER
That didn't really go anywhere.
And... my semester in Rome. Daniele
Belardelli. AKA The Puma.
 Still photograph of THE PUMA. A swarthy Italian
posing in front of a Vespa moped in tight Gucci pants, his
boner clearly trying to escape.
TOM
The Puma?
SUMMER
Yeah, cause, you know...
Tom has no idea. And he doesn't want to know.
TOM
And that's it?
SUMMER
The ones that lasted.
TOM
What happened? Why didn't they work
out?
SUMMER
Nothing happened really. It's what
always happens. Life.
On TOM. Silent for a few beats. Did he want to hear that?
