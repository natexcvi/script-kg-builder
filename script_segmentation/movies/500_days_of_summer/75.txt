EXT. FOREST  DAY

Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
TOM V.O.
Five. Travel. Take some time to
see another environment. Get
perspective. It's a beautiful
world. It will be for you again
someday.
This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to
the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
takes a deep breath.
FREEZE ON TOM.
INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that
Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
has Tom sized up in his rifle sight.
UNFREEZE.
Tom starts to itch...
