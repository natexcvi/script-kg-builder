INT OFFICE WAITING AREA  DAY

Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
time.
Tom waits.
We notice, before he does, a VERY E GIRL sitting in a
another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
GIRL
Are you here to interview?
TOM
Sorry?
GIRL
Are you interviewing? For the
position?
TOM
Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
GIRL
Yup.
TOM
Ah. My competition.
GIRL
It would appear.
TOM
Gee, this is a little awkward.
GIRL
Yes it is.
TOM
Well, I hope you don't get it.
GIRL
I hope you don't get it.
They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
girl. This girl is cute. He had like to talk more with her.
And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
TOM
So, uh...
GIRL
Hmm?
TOM
Are you from...California?
GIRL
Grew up not too far from here.
Atherton, near Stanford.
TOM
I know Atherton. Nice area.
GIRL
Have I seen you before?
TOM
I, uh, don't know. I don't think
so.
GIRL
Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to
pray or anything but to stand
outside?
TOM
I do! I love that church. It's like
my favorite structure in the city.
GIRL
If only it wasn't near that
horrible mirrored thing...
TOM
Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
GIRL
Yeah.
I think I have seen you there.
TOM
You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see
you.
GIRL
It happens. You probably weren't
looking.
A MAN comes out.
MAN
Tom Hansen?
TOM
Yes.
MAN
Come on back.
TOM
Thank you.
He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
and looks back at the girl.
NARRATOR
If Tom had learned anything... it
was that you can't ascribe great
cosmic significance to a simple
earthly event. Coincidence. That's
all anything ever is. Nothing more
than coincidence.
ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
NARRATOR
It took a long time but Tom had
finally learned. There are no
miracles. There's no such thing as
fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
knew. He was sure of it now.
Tom was...
Tom turns back around.
NARRATOR
...pretty sure.
TOM
to Girl
Excuse me.
GIRL
Hello stranger.
TOM
When this is over... uh... would
you like to maybe...grab a cup of
coffee or something?
GIRL
Oh. I am sorta supposed to meet
someone.
TOM
DEFLATED
Oh. Got it... No problem.
He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
GIRL
Ok.
Tom turns back around.
TOM
What's that?
GIRL
Why not?
TOM
Yeah?
GIRL
Yeah.
TOM
Great! So... I will wait for you
here, or you wait for me
or...something.
She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.
GIRL
We will figure it out.
TOM
Ok!
extends hand to shake
My name's Tom.
GIRL
Nice to meet you...
She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.
GIRL
I am Autumn.
And on his face...
