INT CONFERENCE ROOM  DAY

Tom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie
is in midpresentation.
MCKENZIE
Now I know this may be a little
risque...but if New Hampshire
Greetings wants the jump on those
conservative, rightwing neoNazis
at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach. The nuclear
family is dead and we need a new
holiday to recognize that.
Mckenzie holds up a homemade photoshopped family portrait of
Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from Jerry
Maguire.
MCKENZIE
May 21st. Other Mother's Day.
The coworkers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of
the department.
VANCE
Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea
McKenzie. Along with Grossman's
Magellan Day I had say we have got
some potential here. What do you
think Hansen? Could you write up
some prototypes for these?
Tom is about to answer when... the door opens.
SUMMER
Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a
call for you on line 3.
And in walks this girl. Summer. We have met her by now but Tom
hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from
that moment on, he can't take them off her.
VANCE
to the table
Everyone this is Summer, my new
assistant. Summer just moved here
from...
SUMMER
Michigan.
VANCE
Right. Michigan. Well, Summer,
everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse
me, I have to take this.
SUMMER
Nice to meet you all.
Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out.
She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen
God.
