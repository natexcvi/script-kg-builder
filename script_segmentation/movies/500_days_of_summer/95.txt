INT TOM'S BATHROOM  NIGHT

Tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. A punkish
pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down
to. He's excited.
He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He
brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and
plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into
the mirror.
Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.
