INT TOM'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
in thought.
Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
 SPLITSCREEN  DAY
On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
Thinking.
On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
lifted. And she's a bride.
END MUSIC.
