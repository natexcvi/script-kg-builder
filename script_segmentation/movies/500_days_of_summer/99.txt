INT WEDDINGS AND ANNIVERSARIES SUITE  LATER

All of the people who work in here are MIDDLE AGED WOMEN.
Currently, they are standing around one desk where Tom sits
writing everyone's cards.
TOM
This is good Millie. To my wife,
the love of my life. I love you.
That's very nice. I was thinking

meet is meaningless and
incomplete. You know, spice it up
a little.
The Women clutch their heart like they might faint.
