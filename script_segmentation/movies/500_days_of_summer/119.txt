INT BOARDROOM  LATER

Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his
usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.
A female COWORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
midpresentation, showing slides that have something to do
with a cat in various poses. First we see, Cat Reaching Up
for OutofReach Milk Bowl.
COWORKER
This one says Go for it!
She clicks to the next slide. Cat Hanging From Tree Branch.
COWORKER
This one says Don't give up!
Click. We see Cat Considering a Giant Leap.
COWORKER
And this one says You can do it!
We have a whole line of
inspirational cards featuring
Pickles, my cat. I think people
will really enjoy them. Thank you.
She takes her seat.
VANCE.
Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
inspirational stuff. Now, who's
next. We haven't heard from
Sympathy in a while. Hansen...
TOM
reacting to his name
Hmm?
VANCE.
The Winter collection. You have
anything to contribute?
TOM
Uh...no. I really don't.
VANCE.
You have nothing?
TOM
Well I wouldn't say nothing...
Actually, that's about right.
VANCE.
DISAPPOINTED
Oh...k. We will come back to you.
McKenzie 
TOM
You know what...?
VANCE.
Yes Tom.
TOM
Can I say something about the cat?
VANCE
Well sure. Go ahead.
TOM
This here is, and Rhoda, you know I
mean no disrespect... but this...
this is total shit.
MCKENZIE
Tom!
TOM
Don't give up? You can do it?
He points to the screen, still showing the Cat About to
Leap image.
TOM
This isn't inspirational. It's
suicidal. He tries that jump, I am
writing a sympathy card for that
cat. That's the last thing I want
to be doing with my life. It's bad
enough writing these things for
people.
VANCE
Hansen, this is a place of
business. We don't cut down our co
workers 
TOM
That's cause we are liars! It's what
we do here. Why don't we level with
people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
COWORKER RHODA
We are a greeting card company.
TOM
Yes but think about it! Why do
people buy these things? Not to say
how they feel. There's paper and
pens for that. People give these
cards when they can't say how they
feel. Or they are afraid to. And we
provide the service that lets em
get away with that!
Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing
uncomfortable.
TOM
I say to hell with it! Let's level
with America. Or at least make them
speak for themselves! I mean,
seriously, what's this...
picks a card off the
TABLE
I am sorry to hear your grandmother
has passed. What the hell? Let's
give em some truth. Something like,
Sorry to hear about your
grandmother. Here's a card so I get
some credit in your time of need.
I am sure it makes up for the fact
that grandma's dead.
Vance and the cardwriting team are appalled.
TOM
Think about it.
picks up another card
Congratulations on your new baby.
Eh... How bout... Congratulations
on your new baby... Guess that's it
for hanging out. Nice knowing ya,
buddy.
VANCE
Hansen, sit down!
TOM
picks up a card
Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy!
Look at this one with all the
hearts. Let's open it up. Happy
Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love
you. Oh that's nice.
MCKENZIE
Tom...
TOM
If someone gave me this card, Mr.
Vance... I would eat it.
MCKENZIE
Tom!
Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the
boardroom table.
TOM
It's these greeting cards, Sir,
these cards, these movies, these
pop songs. They are responsible for
all the lies, the heartache,
everything! We are responsible!
Everyone shifts in their seats.
TOM
I think we do a bad thing here.
People should be able to say how
they feel, how they really feel,
without some strangers putting
words in their mouths. The truth. A
card is a nice thought but it
shouldn't do the dirty work for
you. You love someone, tell them
yourself, in your own words. Maybe
it's not love at all. Maybe there's
no such thing as love. Maybe
it's... galoogoo.
Yeah I made it up, so what?!
Tom gets up and walks to the door.
TOM
It's all crap. We make and peddle
crap. And sometimes people believe
in this crap. I just can't do it
anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough
bullshit in the world without my
help. I quit.
And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
doesn't really take.
