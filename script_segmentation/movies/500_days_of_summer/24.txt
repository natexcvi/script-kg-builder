INT. OFFICE  DAY

Tom trying to work. And failing. He turns to McKenzie.
TOM
What do we know about this new
girl?
MCKENZIE
Who?
TOM
The new girl. Summer. In Vance's
office.
MCKENZIE
Dude. I hear she's a bitch from
hell!
TOM
DISAPPOINTED
Really?
MCKENZIE
Patel tried to talk to her in the
copy room. She was totally not
having it.
TOM
Maybe she was just in a hurry.
MCKENZIE
And maybe she's some uppity, better
than everyone, superskank.
TOM
Damn.
MCKENZIE
I know. She's pretty hot.
TOM
That makes me so mad! Why is it
pretty girls always think they can
treat people like crap and get away
with it?
MCKENZIE
Dunno.
TOM
Like, just cause she has high
cheekbones and soft skin...
MCKENZIE
...and really good teeth.
TOM
And maybe the world's most perfect
breasts...Just cause of that stuff,
she can walk around like she's
center of the universe?
MCKENZIE
as explanation
Women.
TOM
Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We
haven't even met and I can't stand
her already.
