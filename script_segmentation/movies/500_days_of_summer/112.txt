INT TOM'S BEDROOM

Tom is going apeshit in his room. He's ripping down posters,
taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He
punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He
tries to find something to kick and can't. He throws his cell
phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.
