INT TOM'S BEDROOM  MORNING

Tom wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls
onto the floor and begins a brief pushup routine.
NARRATOR V.O.
Most days of the year are entirely
unremarkable. They begin and they
end without creating a single
lasting memory. Most days have no
real impact on the course of a
life.
The phone rings. Tom stops his pushups to answer it.
NARRATOR V.O.
May 8th was a Saturday.
