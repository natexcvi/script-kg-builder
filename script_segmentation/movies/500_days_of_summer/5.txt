INT BATHROOM  1994

Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair
extends down to her lower back.
NARRATOR
Since the disintegration of her
parents' marriage, she had only loved
two things. The first was her long
blonde hair.
She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.
NARRATOR
The second was how easily she could
cut it off... And feel nothing.
