INT OFFICE  DAY

Tom is wandering through the office whistling.
MCKENZIE
Hansen, don't you have like twenty
bar mitzvah cards to write?
TOM
Nope. All done. What are you
working on?
MCKENZIE
Congratulations. But I have run out
of ways to say it. Good job,
well done, way to go... I got
nothing.
TOM
Why don't you try... Everyday you
make me proud. But today, you get a
card.
MCKENZIE
Shit. That's not bad.
TOM
No worries.
Tom walks by the room marked Weddings and Anniversaries.
He's about to keep going when he pauses.
