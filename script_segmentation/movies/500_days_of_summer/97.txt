INT SUMMER'S APARTMENT  SAME

Summer on the cell as she enters her apartment. She looks
like she's coming back from the gym.
SUMMER
Hey it's me.
TOM
Hello me. You having a good day?
SUMMER
I am thank you. Listen, about
tonight... I think I might just
stay in and go to bed early.
TOM
What? Why?
SUMMER
I am just really tired and I have
gotta go in early tomorrow. Would
you be super mad at me if we went
out this weekend instead?
TOM
Well... You don't want to just,
maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you have
gotta eat right?
SUMMER
I am not really that hungry. And
this place is fancy right?
TOM
touching his tie
Sorta.
SUMMER
I had rather not. Seriously, do you
mind?
Tom is standing still now, no longer moving. He's trying to
keep his frustration from being audible.
TOM
Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you
want to do.
SUMMER
Thank you. So we will talk tomorrow,
alright?
TOM
Sure.
SUMMER
Great. Good night Tom.
TOM
Good night.
Hey, Happy... birthday.
But the line is dead. Tom's head sinks into his chest. Yet
another frustrating night...
CU PAUL, TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA DOCUMENTARY STYLE
PAUL
I just got lucky I guess. We met in
elementary school. We had the same
class schedule in the 7th grade and
we just... clicked.
CU MCKENZIE.
MCKENZIE
Love? Shit, I don't know. As long
as she's cute and she's willing,
right? Actually, cute is a strong
word. Not atrocious.
CU RACHEL.
RACHEL
That's a pretty complex question.
Philosophers, poets, scientists,
everybody has a theory, don't they?

I kinda like what Nietzsche said
There is always some madness in
love, but there is also...always
some reason in madness. Think
about it. Pretty smart. Although,
Nietzsche also said Kill the
Jews. So there's that.
CU VANCE.
VANCE.
I have been happily married for 30
years. She's the light that guides
me home.
Yes it is from one of our cards.
No someone else wrote it. Doesn't
make it less true.
CU SUMMER
SUMMER
Ok I am sick of this love shit. Come
on! We have been fed this nonsense
for generations to the point where
it's now genetically encoded in our
very beings. And what does it mean?
Absolutely nothing. Give me a
break!
CU MCKENZIE
MCKENZIE
I am just saying... I really need
some ass. I am desperate.
You got nothing?
CU PAUL
PAUL
I wouldn't say the girl of my
dreams, no. The girl of my dreams
would have a better rack. Probably
different hair, could like sports a
little more. But... truth is...
Robyn's better than the girl of my
dreams.
You know why? Cause she's real.
CU TOM.
He says nothing. Just stands there. So confused. We go right
IN
