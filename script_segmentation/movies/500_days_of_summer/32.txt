INT LOCAL DIVE BAR  HAPPY HOUR

Tom removes his headphones and sits defeated with McKenzie
and Paul in a booth.
TOM
It's off.
PAUL
What?
TOM
Me and Summer.
MCKENZIE
Was it ever on?
TOM
No. But it could have been. In a
world where good things happen to
me.
PAUL
Yeah well, that's not really where
we live.
TOM
No.
MCKENZIE
So what happened?
TOM
You ready for this?
