INT. OFFICE  LATER

Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose.
Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops
short.
TOM
GENUINE
Hi.
SUMMER
COLD
Hi.
TOM
What's up?
SUMMER
Nothing.
TOM
Ok.
Nothing else is said.
TOM
Wait, are you still mad at me?
SUMMER
rolling her eyes
Tom...
TOM
Holy shit you are. I can't believe
you!
SUMMER
re copies
Are you almost done?
TOM
Yeah. I am all done.
He starts to walk out.
TOM
You know what... Sometimes you
really don't make any sense.
Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she
looks back at him, he's gone.
LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk.
She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but
she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there.
LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle
but he's already gone.
