INT KARAOKE BAR  LATER

Tom is, yes, on stage singing another song by The Clash,
Train in Vain. Not so much singing as having a nervous
breakdown to music.
TOM
You said you had stand by your
man!So tell me something I don't
understand. You said you loved
me!And that's a fact! And then you
left me, said you felt trapped!
Alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face.
TOM
You didn't stand by me! Not at
all! You didn't stand by me, I am
talking about you Summer!
On Alison, having the worst date ever.
