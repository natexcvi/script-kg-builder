EXT. PARK  DAY

Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
SUMMER V.O.
Hey.
Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
do.
SUMMER
re suit
Where you coming from?
TOM
What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
you been sitting there?
SUMMER
Awhile.
Tom finds it hard to look at her.
SUMMER
I come here a lot. I always loved
this place, ever since you brought
me here.
The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
TOM
So... I should probably say
congratulations.
SUMMER
Probably. But only if you mean it.
TOM
I don't know if I do honestly.
SUMMER
I understand.
TOM
Yeah well...anyway...I hope you are
happy.
SUMMER
You really do?
TOM
God no.
They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
SUMMER
How are you, Tom?
TOM
I am good. Ish.
SUMMER
That's good.
TOM
Yeah I quit the office.
SUMMER
Really? That's great! What are you
doing now?
TOM
Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
Awkward silence.
TOM
So who's the guy?
SUMMER
Who, my guy?
TOM
Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I
don't want to know.
SUMMER
Tom...
TOM
No really, I don't.
SUMMER
Ok.
More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And
THEN
TOM
It's amazing to me. You are married.
SUMMER
I know.
TOM
You are not only someone's
girlfriend, your someone's wife!
SUMMER
Pretty crazy, huh?
TOM
SIGHS
I will never understand that.
SUMMER
Tom 
TOM
What's different now? How could
things change so quickly?
SUMMER
I don't know. It just happened.
TOM
What happened?! That's what I don't
get.
SUMMER
I... Tom...
TOM
What, tell me...
SUMMER
I woke up one day and I knew.
Tom says nothing.
SUMMER
I knew I could promise him I had feel
the same way every morning. In a
way that I... I never could with
you.
And there's not much else to say after that.
Tom gets up to leave.
TOM
You know what sucks? Realizing that
everything you believe in is
complete bullshit.
SUMMER
What is?
TOM
Destiny, soulmates, true love. All
that stuff. It's nothing more than
silly childhood fairy tale
nonsense, isn't it? God!
SUMMER
Tom, don't go.
TOM
I should have listened to you,
Summer. You were right all along.
Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
SUMMER
I was right?
And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
TOM
What? This is funny?
Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
completely cracking up.
TOM
What are you laughing at?
And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
TOM
trying himself not to
LAUGH
You are a crazy person!
SUMMER
Tom! You are the crazy person!
TOM
What are you talking about?!
SUMMER
One day I am reading a book at the
corner deli and this guy sits down
and starts asking about it. Now
he's my husband!
TOM
This is funny to you?
SUMMER
What would have happened if I went
to the movies instead? If I went
somewhere else for lunch? If I
showed up to eat ten minutes later?
Tom, it was meant to be, just like
you said. And as it was happening,
I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
the sun. And I kept thinking to
myself Holy shit. Tom was right.
You were right about all of it.
It just wasn't me you were right
about.
Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
SUMMER
Anyway, I should probably be
getting back. It was good to see
you. I am glad you are well.
Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a
SECOND
TOM
Summer!
She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
for the last time ever.
TOM
I really do hope you are happy.
SUMMER
I know.
See you later.
And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
second.
