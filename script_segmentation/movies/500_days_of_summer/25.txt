INT. ELEVATOR  LATER

Tom is listening to headphones. Summer enters the elevator
and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her. Summer hears
the music.
SUMMER
The Smiths.
Tom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an
unenthusiastic wave.
SUMMER
I love The Smiths.
Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones.
TOM
Sorry?
SUMMER
I said. I love The Smiths. You have
good taste in music.
A beat as Tom processes this information.
TOM
AMAZED
You like the Smiths?
SUMMER
SINGING
To die by your side is such a
heavenly way to die. Love it.
The elevator doors open and she gets off.
TOM
accidentally out loud
Oh my god.
