EXT DELI  SAME AS EARLIER

Tom and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli.
TOM
There's no fucking way!
MCKENZIE
Tom.
TOM
It can't be. It's impossible!
PAUL
It is.
TOM
How do you know?
MCKENZIE
We know.
TOM
But... It's May! We broke up last
August.
PAUL
I know.
TOM
And you said she was single at
Christmas.
MCKENZIE
She was.
TOM
And now she's...
MCKENZIE
Yeah.
TOM
Now she's getting married.
PAUL
I am so sorry Tom.
TOM
Married?
PAUL
It's insane.
TOM
It's impossible. It doesn't make
sense. Where did they meet? Is it
someone we know?
PAUL
No.
TOM
So everything she said. All that
stuff about... it can't be. Not
her. I know her too well. She
wouldn't do that.
His friends say nothing.
TOM
Fuck!
And with that he storms off.
MCKENZIE
Tom!
PAUL
Let him go.
Literally, his entire universe falls apart.
FX BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to
rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is
ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen
force and reduced to nothing.

And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF HAVA NAGILA.

CU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some old,
Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a
cult?
We are
