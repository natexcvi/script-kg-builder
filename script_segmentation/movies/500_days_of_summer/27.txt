INT TOM'S PLACE  DAY

Tom is playing Playstation with Rachel.
TOM
And it turns out she's read every
Graham Greene novel ever published.
Her desk is lined with Magritte
posters and Edward Hopper.
RACHEL
Your favorites.
TOM
We are so compatible it's insane!
Seriously! It doesn't make sense!
She's not like I thought at all.
She's... amazing.
RACHEL
Oh boy.
TOM
What?
RACHEL
You know...just cause some cute
girl likes the same bizarro music
you do doesn't make her the one.
TOM
Of course it does.
SARAH O.S.
Dinner!
SARAH, 50s, Tom and Rachel's mother, stands in the doorway.
SARAH
Pause and come eat.
They do. Tom enters the living room area and sits down next
to his stepdad MARTIN, 60s, a quiet, professorial Southern
gentleman type.
TOM
Hey Martin.
RACHEL
He met a girl.
SARAH
EXCITED
Yeah?
RACHEL
GRIM
Yeah.
Sarah grows serious too.
SARAH
Oh shit.
STOCK FOOTAGE.
The Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven's Gate, Neil Armstrong.
NARRATOR
When one strongly believes in
something, it takes overwhelming
contradictory evidence to change
their minds.
END ON
LITTLE TOM, age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of
Olivia NewtonJohn in Xanadu.
NARRATOR
Tom had always been a devout
believer in the idea of true
love.
The evidence did not support him.
