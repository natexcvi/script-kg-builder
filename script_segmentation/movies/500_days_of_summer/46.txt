INT CHINESE RESTAURANT  NIGHT

Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much. At another
table, Tom sees a VERY UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE feeding each other
food.
TOM
Check them out.
Summer sees. She has no reaction.
TOM
SARCASTIC
That is hot.
Summer keeps eating.
TOM
I am very turned on right now.
SUMMER
Sometimes you can be so judgmental.
TOM
Huh?
SUMMER
I mean, who are you? They are happy.
Just mind your own business.
Summer goes back to eating. Tom can't believe she snapped.
