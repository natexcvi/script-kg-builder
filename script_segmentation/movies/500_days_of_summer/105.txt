INT CLUB  NIGHT

Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking
miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not
really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with
everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with
sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.
SUMMER
You are not having any fun.
TOM
You are having enough for both of
us.
SUMMER
I am dancing. I haven't danced in
ages. God. Come on.
TOM
No.
SUMMER
Come on! I wanna dance with you.
TOM
Where were you an hour ago? I might
have danced then. I have been
standing here by myself this whole
time and you didn't look over once.
SUMMER
So you are pissed?
TOM
I am not pissed. Summer... you know
I hate this shit.
SUMMER
Then why are you here?
TOM
This is what you wanted to do
so...we are doing it.
SUMMER
Yeah well, I didn't need a
chaperone. Go home. You are a
buzzkill standing there pouting.
TOM
HURT
That's real nice.
He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second.
SUMMER
Tom!
But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and
starts dancing again.
LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the
music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is
alone. He can't believe it's come to this.
