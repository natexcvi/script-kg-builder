INT. APARTMENT  LATER

Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.
LATER. He hangs some new pictures.
LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
something.
