EXT OFFICE BUILDING  DAY

Tom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand
outside the building.
SUMMER
You wanna 
TOM
No you go first.
SUMMER
It doesn't matter to me.
TOM
Whatever you want.
A COWORKER passes.
COWORKER
Hey Summer. Tom.
BOTH
like nothing's up
Hey. Hi.
Summer joins the coworker and walks in.
SUMMER
to CoWorker
So how's it going?
She turns back to look at Tom on the way. She sticks out her
tongue to be cute. CoWorker doesn't see. Tom is crazy about
her.
