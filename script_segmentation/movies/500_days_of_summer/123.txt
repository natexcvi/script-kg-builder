EXT PARK  DAY

Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar,
it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful
day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it
all, finally, fell apart.
TOM
So how was last night?
SUMMER
It was fine. Just a work thing.
TOM
Where did you guys go?
SUMMER
Some restaurant.
TOM
Fun?
SUMMER
Uneventful. Didn't get home until
after 12 though which is way too
late for a stupid work function.
How was your night?
TOM
Pretty standard.
Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of
silence.
