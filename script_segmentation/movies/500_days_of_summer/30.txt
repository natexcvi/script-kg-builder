INT AIRPLANE  DAY

COLLEGE TOM sits next to his girlfriend REBECCA MYLES. His
smile gleams.
TOM
I am so glad we decided to go away
together Bec. I know we have only
been dating a few months but it's
been...awesome.
NARRATOR
Exhibit C Rebecca Myles.
TOM
And now, you and me, 8 days in
Mexico... best spring break ever!
Across the aisle Rebecca makes eye contact with three COLLEGE
DUDES.
REBECCA
I think we should see other people.
