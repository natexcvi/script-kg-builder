EXT STREET  MORNING

It's the greatest morning of all time!
Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts
down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,
winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
singing the song.
Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
every time he touches the pavement like in Billie Jean.
CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at
them.
