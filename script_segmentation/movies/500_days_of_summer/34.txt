INT LOCAL DIVE BAR  AS BEFORE

The friends wait for more.
TOM
You believe that shit?
MCKENZIE
What shit?
PAUL
I think I missed something.
TOM
It was good. She didn't say It
was good. She said It was good.
Emphasis on the good. She basically
said I spent the weekend having
sex with this guy I met at the
gym. Fucking whore. Screw her.
It's over.
Everyone's silent.
MCKENZIE
What the hell is wrong with you?!
PAUL
Dude, you got problems.
TOM
She's not interested in me. There's
nothing I can do.
MCKENZIE
Based on...it was good?
TOM
And some other things.
PAUL
Like what, she said hey instead
of hi cause that totally means
she's a lesbian.
TOM
I gave her all sorts of chances.
