INT OFFICE  TOM'S CUBICLE  DAY

Tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work. But
with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard
time concentrating.
McKenzie shares a cubicle with Tom.
MCKENZIE
This Friday. 10 bucks all you can
karaoke at The Well.
TOM
No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.
MCKENZIE
Come on!
SINGING
Take me down to the paradise city
where the grass is green and they
got big titties!
TOM
They won't let you back in there
after last time.
MCKENZIE
I wasn't that bad.
TOM
Not at all. You just threw up on
the stage, tried to fight the
bartender, and then threatened to
burn the place down before passing
out on the sidewalk. Quiet night
for you.
MCKENZIE
REVERENTIAL
You saved my life that day.
TOM
We are not going back there.
MCKENZIE
This is a work thing, Tommy. It
won't be like that. The whole
office is going.
TOM
I really can't. Even if I wanted
to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta
take care of.
MCKENZIE
You are not listening to me.
TOM
What?
MCKENZIE
The whole office is going.
Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on
him...
