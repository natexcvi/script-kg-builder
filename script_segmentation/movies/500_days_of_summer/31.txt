EXT CAR  NIGHT

Younger Tom sits in the passenger seat. Ravenhaired AMANDA
drives.
NARRATOR
And, finally... Exhibit D Amanda
Heller.
AMANDA
It's just... it's complicated.
TOM
What's complicated? Last week you
said you loved me!
AMANDA
I know it's sudden but...
TOM
No, this can't be. Everything was
going so great. I don't understand.
AMANDA
Here.
TOM
What's this?
She puts a disc into the cd player.
AMANDA
Because you are, like, the biggest
music nerd I have ever met, I think
this should really help explain
where I am coming from.
A pop song begins to play on the stereo. They listen for a
few beats. Tom is confused.
AMANDA
You remember how much I loved this
song when you first played it for
me?
TOM
Sure. It's all you wanted to listen
to for weeks.
AMANDA
Right. And I still like it, don't
get me wrong. It's just... When I
hear it now, I don't feel the
same...rush.
TOM
still confused
Ok...
AMANDA
I press the skip button.
Still Tom doesn't understand.
TOM
What does this have to do with?
AMANDA
I had rather listen to something
else.
And with that, it slowly sinks in for him.
TOM
But Amanda... this is a great
fucking song!
