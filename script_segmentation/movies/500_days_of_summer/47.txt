INT RESTAURANT  NIGHT

An equally UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE go at it in a booth. PAN
ACROSS to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in
a booth across the room, watching in hysterics.
TOM
9, 9.5?
SUMMER
Too soon to say. It's all in the
dismount.
TOM
If we are lucky, there won't be a
dismount.
Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it
again. They are having a great night.
SUMMER
I can't believe them. I have like
zero patience for PDA.
TOM
I hear ya. If I want to watch
people make out, I have big windows
and binoculars at home.
SUMMER
Yeah?
TOM
No. That would be wrong.
They laugh some more. She is in hysterics.
SUMMER
This is fun. You are fun.
TOM
Thanks.
SUMMER
I mean, I just want to say, up
front, I am not looking for anything
serious.
Tom is a little surprised.
SUMMER
Are you cool with that?
TOM
UNCONVINCING
Sure.
SUMMER
It freaks some guys out when I say
that.
TOM
still confused
Not me.
SUMMER
Let's just have fun. Let's
just...hang out, no pressure, no
labels, no obligations.
Ok?
Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it.
TOM
Sure.
SUMMER
Wanna hold my hand under the table?
A beat.
TOM
Yeah.
