INT BAR

On Tom
TOM
I think it's...kind of a huge
thing.
SUMMER
Ok. Looks like we are gonna have to
agree to disagree on that one.
McKenzie senses some discontent.
MCKENZIE
So, uh, who's singing next?
SUMMER
re singing
I had say it's your turn loverboy.
TOM
Nooo. I don't sing in public.
SUMMER
Sure you do. I see you lipsynching
to your headphones every morning on
your way in.
TOM
I don't...
MCKENZIE
You really do.
SUMMER
It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of
selfconfidence to look ridiculous.
MCKENZIE
can't help himself
Selfconfidence! Ha!
Tom elbows him in the ribs again.
TOM
Anyway, I am not near drunk enough
to sing in front of all these
people.
SUMMER
Ok then. Let's drink.
TOM
It would take at least ten shots to
get me to sing.
SUMMER
Bartender!
TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's
Magnificent Seven. You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK
STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in
the bar singing along to the audienceparticipation parts.
It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.
LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming
something.
TOM
That's not it.
SUMMER
What is that then?
TOM
I have no idea.
They are both having a good time.
SUMMER
I used to watch it every week.
TOM
Me too. Why can't we think of the
stupid ATeam theme song.
SUMMER
Pathetic.
TOM
This is gonna bother me for weeks.
SUMMER
Totally.
They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good
way.
Be an American. He really means it. At any minute he might
start to cry.
MCKENZIE
And I had proudly stand UP!
aggressive drunk
I said stand!
BACK ON TOM and SUMMER.
TOM
Oh here we go.
