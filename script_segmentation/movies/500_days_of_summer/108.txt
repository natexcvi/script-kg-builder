TOM
You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?
VANCE
Yes Hansen. Sit down.

Ok.
VANCE.
Has something happened to you
recently?
TOM
What do you mean?
VANCE
A death in the family, someone
taken ill...anything like that?

this have something to do with
Summer leaving.

TOM
faking badly
Your...?
VANCE.
Tom...everyone knows. Nevermind.
The reason I am asking... lately
your work performance has been... a
little off.
TOM
I am not following.
VANCE
For example, here's something you
wrote last week...
reads from a card on his
DESK
Roses are Red, Violets are Blue.
Fuck You Whore. Now...most
shoppers on Valentine's Day 
TOM
Mr. Vance... are you firing me?
VANCE
No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You are
one of our most... adequate
writers.
TOM
Ok. Well, I am sorry. Things for me
have been a little difficult.
VANCE
That's ok. I understand that. I was
just thinking... perhaps you could
channel your energy into... this.
He hands him some sympathy cards.
TOM
Funerals and sympathy?
VANCE
Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no
reasons to live... it's perfect for
you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now
back to work you go.
He quickly ushers him out of the office.
