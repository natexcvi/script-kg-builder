INT TOM'S PLACE  LATER

PAUL and MCKENZIE open the door. These are Tom's best friends
since birth. Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs.
McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom.
PAUL
I didn't know who else to call.
The Girl removes her bike helmet.
GIRL
You did the right thing. Where is
he?
Tom is in the kitchen breaking things and basically going
insane. About to smash a plate on the floor, he's interrupted
BY
GIRL
Thomas.
Tom freezes.
TOM
Rachel? What are you doing here?
GIRL RACHEL
I am here to help you.
TOM
Help me how?
RACHEL
First, put down the plate.
Tom slowly obliges.
RACHEL
Now come here and sit down.
Tom sits next to the young girl. Paul and Mckenzie sit on
either side of them.
RACHEL
The key is not to panic.
TOM
I think I am gonna be sick.
RACHEL
Drink this.
She hands him a glass of water. Tom drinks it down.
MCKENZIE
What is that?
RACHEL
Vodka.
TOM
grimacing at the taste
More.
He gulps another down.
TOM
Does Mom know you are here? It's
gotta be past 10.
RACHEL
Don't worry about it. Start from
the beginning. Tell us what
happened...
Tom takes a deep breath.
