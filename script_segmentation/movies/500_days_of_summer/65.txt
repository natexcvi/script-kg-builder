INT SPORTS BAR  NIGHT

Tom, Mckenzie and Paul are having a drink.
PAUL
So what's going on with you and
Summer?
TOM
I don't know.
PAUL
Is she your girlfriend?
TOM
I wouldn't say that.
MCKENZIE
What would you say?
TOM
Like, are we going steady? Come
on, guys. We are adults.
PAUL
It's not an unreasonable question.
Watch. McKenzie, do you have a
girlfriend?
MCKENZIE
No I do not. In fact girls are
repulsed by me. Paul, how about
you?
PAUL
Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is
Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
TOM
It is when you have been with the
same girl since high school.
PAUL
You have been seeing this girl,
what, two months now?
TOM
Something like that.
PAUL
And you haven't discussed it?
TOM
No! She's not... We are not like
that.
PAUL
Like what?
MCKENZIE
Normal.
TOM
We have just been... hanging out.
PAUL
Hanging out?!
TOM
Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we
know how we feel. We don't need to
label it. Boyfriend, girlfriend.
That stuff is very... juvenile.
Beat.
MCKENZIE
You are so gay.
PAUL
Well let me ask you this then. Do
you want her to be your girlfriend?
Tom takes a second to think about this.
TOM
I don't know... Maybe.
MCKENZIE
I heard her Hansen. She's not the
girlfriend type. You are gonna need
to discuss it.
TOM
No. We are adults. It will be fine.
MCKENZIE
Have you made her a CD yet?
TOM
Maybe.
MCKENZIE
Oh dude.
PAUL
You really need to have that talk.
