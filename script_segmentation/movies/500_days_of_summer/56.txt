EXT SONY METREON  DAY

Tom and Summer in front of the gargantuan mirrored building.
TOM
No. See now, this is torture.
SUMMER
Why?
TOM
Over there, that's St. Patrick's
church. The beauty of St. Patrick's
is its humility. With this giant
mirror thing deflecting all the
attention away, it's too humble. No
one even knows it's there.
SUMMER
How would you change it?
TOM
There's a million things. First,
there's no need for this much
glass. You could easily...
SUMMER
Show me.
TOM
What?
SUMMER
Don't talk about it. Do it.
Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of
her arm. Tom thinks about this. Then he starts to draw a
sketch on her skin. We catch her watching his face as he
draws. She's attracted to his enthusiasm.
TOM
See this beam, it steps on the
landscape. But if we moved it...
just so...
