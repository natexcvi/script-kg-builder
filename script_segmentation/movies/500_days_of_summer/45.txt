INT TOM'S PLACE  THAT NIGHT

Tom answers the door. It's Paul in hospital scrubs.
PAUL
You son of a bitch.
He walks inside without waiting for an invite.
PAUL
Last night, karaoke night?
TOM
ANXIOUS
Shhh.
PAUL
The same girl you had been whining
and crying and bitching about for
weeks now?
TOM
I have not been...
PAUL
The same girl you said was way out
of your league and you had have no
chance with no matter what. That
girl?
TOM
Paul, seriously...
PAUL
Did you bang her?
TOM
No!
PAUL
Blow job?
TOM
No!
PAUL
Hand job?
TOM
No, Paul, no jobs. I am still
unemployed. We just kissed.
PAUL
Come on, level with me. As your
best friend, who tolerated a whole
month of talk talk talk about this
girl, nothing but Summer this,
Summer that, Summer Summer Summer,
I mean you were practically
stalking her...
TOM
Shhh!
Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the
bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out.
PAUL
Oh crap.
SUMMER
Hi, I am Summer..
PAUL
Summer, wow what an unusual name.
I am sure I had remember that if I had
heard it before. Tom, how come
you have never mentioned you knew
such a lovely little lady?
off Tom's nasty look
Or perhaps you have and I have just
forgot.
to Summer
I mean, with all the women in Tom's
life it's hard to keep track...
not helping
Ok, well, I was just... I am Paul.
SUMMER
Hi Paul.
PAUL
not sure what else to
SAY
I am a doctor.
SUMMER
Nice to meet you.
PAUL
Anyway, I am leaving now. Pretend I
was never here. Tom, talk to you
later?... Hey, If any jobs open
up...
Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul.
TOM
If you heard...
SUMMER
Heard what?
TOM
Excellent. You ready to go.
SUMMER
I am stalking, STARVING!
Tom realizes she's heard it all.
TOM
PLAYFULLY
He exaggerates!
