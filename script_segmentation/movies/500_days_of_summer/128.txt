INT TOM'S BEDROOM  DAY

Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.
And then he stops.
He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.
He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.
From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
almost shaped like a tear drop.
