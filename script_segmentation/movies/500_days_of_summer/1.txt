EXT. PARK  DAY

For a few seconds we watch A MAN 20s and a WOMAN 20s on a
park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
a word.
 ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
to be looked at.
A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.
NARRATOR
This is a story of boy meets girl.
