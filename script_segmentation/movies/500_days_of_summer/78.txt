EXT BAR  A FEW MINUTES LATER

Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is
a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it.
TOM
Did you see that punch? I don't
know where it came from. I haven't
punched someone since Josh
Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I am
gonna have to throw out this shirt.
Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first
time she's furious.
TOM
Hey. What is it?
SUMMER

TOM

SUMMER

TOM
What...?
SUMMER
I told you all along what I don't
want and it's...
Tom waits for more. It doesn't come.
SUMMER
I am tired. Can we talk about this
tomorrow?
It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think.
Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.
TOM
calling to her
I just got my ass kicked!
Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this.
TOM
to Onlookers
I got one good shot in.
