INT OFFICE  LATE IN THE DAY

The office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom
and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put
a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's I
Want to Know What Love Is by Foreigner. No reaction from
Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down,
defeated.
