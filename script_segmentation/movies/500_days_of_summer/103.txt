EXT MOVIE THEATRE  NIGHT

Tom and Summer in line to buy tickets.
TOM
You really want to see this?
SUMMER
It sounds amazing.
TOM
It's, like, all stabbing and shit.
SUMMER
Exactly.
TOM
Ok.
SUMMER
All you take me to are sappy little
romances. I want to see some open
wounds, damn it. I want carnage.
TOM
Fantastic.
Suddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line.
TOM
Oh shit.
SUMMER
What?
And here they come, Tom's mom and stepdad, Sarah and Martin.
Tom's face registers a noticeable panic.
SARAH
Hey!
Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah
hugs and kisses her son.
TOM
looking at Summer
Hi Mom.
Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok.
TOM
Mom, Martin, this is Summer.
SARAH
Summer! Well hello! We have heard so
much about you! It's so good to
finally meet you.
Sarah hugs Summer.
SUMMER
You too.
And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices
Summer's face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he
hugging me?
MARTIN
to Tom
Is this the girlfriend?
Tom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do?
TOM
Well this is the girl friend I have
told you about. I don't know if
girlfriend is the right word...
SARAH
You going to see the serial killer
one?
SUMMER
Yes we are.
SARAH
Great! Should we save you seats?
Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for
Summer.
SUMMER
Absolutely.
SARAH
Ok. We will see you inside.
When they are out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is
distraught.
TOM
Sorry about that.
SUMMER
It's fine.
TOM
You wanna go do something else? We
can totally bolt.
SUMMER
Did you tell them I was your
girlfriend?
TOM
What?! No way... I never used that
word.
SUMMER
They seemed to think... I mean, why
is your stepdad giving me a hug?
TOM
He's very...loving.
SUMMER
Does he hug all your friends?
There's that word again.
Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at
him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the
theatre. He's forced to follow. Answerless, as conflicted as
ever. Why is none of this easy?
