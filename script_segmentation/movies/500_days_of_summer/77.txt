INT CROWDED BAR  NIGHT

Summer and Tom stand by the bar.
TOM
I just don't get women's fashion
nowadays. Everybody with the
tattoos, the giant hoop earrings,
those annoying hats. Explain this
to me.
SUMMER
People think it looks good.
TOM
Do you?
SUMMER
On some.
TOM
I like how you dress.
SUMMER
Yeah? What if I started wearing
berets and got a huge butterfly
tattoo on my leg?
TOM
Please don't.
A tall, wellbuilt, GOODLOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly
appeared next to them.
DOUCHE
to Summer
Hey.
Tom and Summer stop talking.
SUMMER
Hey.
DOUCHE
How's it going?
SUMMER
Ok.
Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange
go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more
amused than concerned.
DOUCHE
You live around here?
SUMMER
Yeah not too far.
DOUCHE
I have never seen you here before.
SUMMER
You are not too perceptive.
DOUCHE
Ha. That's funny.
Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry
about.
DOUCHE
So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
SUMMER
No thank you.
As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The
Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of
them together.
DOUCHE
Are you with this guy?
Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.
TOM
Hi. I am Tom.
DOUCHE
Whatever.
to Summer
Come on, one drink. What are you
drinking?
SUMMER
Sorry, no thank you.
Tom is pleased.
DOUCHE
You are serious? This guy?
And now he's pissed.
TOM
Hey buddy 
SUMMER
to the Douche
Don't be rude. I am flattered, I am
just not interested. Now why don't
you go back over there and leave us
alone, ok?
DOUCHE
It's a free country.
Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say now
what? After a beat
DOUCHE
So you and him, huh? I can't
believe that. Is this guy really
your boyfriend?
And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to
cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the
woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost
automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.
Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain Douche's chin, Tom's
fist.
There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.
And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.
