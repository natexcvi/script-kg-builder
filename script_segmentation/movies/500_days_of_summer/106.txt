EXT STREET  MORNING

The worst morning ever.
Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks
down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,
broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still
Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.
He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's
brother Clint looks back.
Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
He walks by a sign that says TODAY ONLY FREE BEER. He
doesn't even stop.
Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.
The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
directions. He doesn't even look up.
Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all
of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.
The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom
tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that.
