INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
Come on, endlessly.
From OFF SCREEN we hear
VINCENT O.S.
Hurry up man! We are losin' her!
LANCE
calling back
I am looking as fast as I can!
Lance continues his frenzied search.
WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.
JODY O.S.
What's he lookin' for?
VINCENT O.S.
I dunno, some medical book.
Jody calls to LANCE.
JODY O.S.
What are you lookin' for?
LANCE
My black medical book!
As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
Jody appears in the doorway.
JODY
Whata are you looking for?
LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's 
like a text book they give to nurses.
JODY
I never saw a medical book.
LANCE
Trust me, I have one.
JODY
Well if it's that important, why 
didn't you keep it with the shot?
Lance spins toward her.
LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!
JODY
While you are lookin' for it, that 
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You are 
never gonna find it in all this shit.  
For six months now, I have been telling 
you to clean this room 
VINCENT O.S.
 get your ass in here, fuck the 
book!
Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
heading for the living room.
LIVING ROOM
Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
reenters the room.
VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
the shot!
Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.
LANCE
While I am doing this, take her shirt 
off and find her heart.
Vince rips her blouse open.
Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.
VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?
LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I am giving 
her an injection in the heart, so I 
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.
VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her 
heart is, I think it's here.
Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
nods.
LANCE
That's it.
As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.
VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got 
one?
JODY
What?
VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any 
felt pen will do, but a magic marker 
would be great.
JODY
Hold on.
Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
of which bills, papers, pens spill to the floor.
The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.
LANCE
It's ready, I will tell you what to 
do.
VINCENT
You are gonna give her the shot.
LANCE
No, you are gonna give her the shot.
VINCENT
I have never does this before.
LANCE
I have never done this before either, 
and I ain't starting now. You brought 
'er here, that means you give her 
the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
bitch to your place, then I gotta 
give her the shot.
Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
marker in her hand.
JODY
Got it.
Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.
VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?
LANCE
Well, you are giving her an injection 
of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
But she's got a breast plate in front 
of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
through that. So what you gotta do 
is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
motion.
Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like The 
Shape killing its victims in HALLOWEEN.
VINCENT
I gotta stab her?
LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce 
through to her heart, you gotta stab 
her hard.
Then once you do, push down on the plunger.
VINCENT
What happens after that?
LANCE
I am curious about that myself.
VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it 
like 
snaps his fingers
 that.
Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
motion.
He looks down on Mia.
Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.
Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.
VINCENT
Count to three.
Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 
what to expect.
LANCE
One...
RED DOT on Mia's body.
Needle raised ready to strike.
LANCE O.S.
...two...
Jody's face is alive with anticipation.
NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.
LANCE O.S.
...three!
The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.
Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
chest.
Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.
The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
out through the needle.
Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
in her chest  SCREAMING.
Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.
Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
air.
The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.
LANCE
If you are okay, say something.
Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
relatively normal voice.
MIA
Something.
Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
shaking from how close to death Mia came.
JODY
Anybody want a beer?
